I blow myself up quite enough already without that thing in the house, thank you.
Besides, I still can't help you unless you have a Blood-Runed Athame to etch a portal.
Err, and that portal must be etched on a piece of prepared Resonating Marble.
The Gates of the Morning has a slab of Marble that once could have served, but a number of, um, incidents have taken their toll.
It'll require a Resonating Diamond to get it properly prepared. Oh, and I want 100 gold.]],
