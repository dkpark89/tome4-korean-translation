She used to go out to his grave every day, until one day she didn't come back. Personally I don't think she was able to live without him; the two were inseparable. If you get a chance on your travels, could you pass by the mausoleum to the east and check... well, you get the idea.

It's strange what death can do to people, how it can take over their minds. Sometimes they forget it's the living that matter... See she gets a proper burial - treated respectfully, eh?]],
