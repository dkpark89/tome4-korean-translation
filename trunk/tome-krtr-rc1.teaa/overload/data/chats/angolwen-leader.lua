He who created this abomination is Urkis. He is a Tempest, a powerful Archmage who channels the storms.
Years ago he went rogue, severing himself from Angolwen. At first he remained quiet, and thus we withheld action, but it seems we have no choice now.
Cleansing the skies will take much time. In the meanwhile, if thou art willing, we can send thee to Urkis' lair to face him.
I will not lie to thee: we can send thee thence, but this could be a death trap, and we have no means for thou to depart his lair, as he lives atop a tall peak in the Daikara mountains.]],
