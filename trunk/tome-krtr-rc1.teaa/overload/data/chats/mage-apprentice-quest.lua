So she set a secret plan into action and built a secret place where magic would be kept alive.
Her plan worked and the group built a town called Angolwen in the western mountains. #LIGHT_GREEN#*He marks it on your map, along with a portal to access it*#WHITE#
Not many people are accepted there but I will arrange for you to be allowed inside.]],
