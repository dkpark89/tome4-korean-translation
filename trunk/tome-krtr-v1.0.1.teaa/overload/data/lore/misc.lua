비록 마법폭발의 힘 앞에 군대가 쓰러지더라도, 비록 숲이 파괴되고 하늘은 불길에 핏빛 빨강으로 불타오를지라도, 대지는 견뎌낼 것이라고, 그들은 느꼈다. 대지는 마치 영원하며, 절대 변하지 않을 것처럼 보였다. 마법폭발의 분노조차 대지를 파괴할 엄두조차 내지 못할 것이라고 생각하였다.

이 얼마나 잘못된 생각이였는가. 날로레 엘프들, 오랫동안 은둔했던 그들은 그들의 땅을 침범하는 어떤 공격에도 맞서 싸울 준비가 되었건만, 대지 자체가 무너지는 것을 그들이 어떻게 막아낼 수 있었겠는가? 그들의 집이 문자 그대로 찢겨지고, 들판과 숲에 금이 가는 것을 보며... 아주 잠시, 끔찍한 순간 동안, 그들은 마법폭발이 지닌 힘의 위력을 보았다. 그 힘은 이 세계의 사람들을 파괴하는 것 뿐만이 아닌, 이 세계 자체를 파괴하는 힘이었다.

날로레들이 살던 대지는 파도 속으로 가라앉았다.]],

그 대재앙이 일어나고 수 년 동안, 혼돈이 그들을 지배하였다. 그들의 문화, 삶의 방식... 그러한 것들은 그들의 대지처럼 부서지고 금이 갔다. 날로레 문명은 소수의 고립되고 연약한 공동체 수준으로 줄어들었다. 이 땅에서 마치 그 존재가 지워진 듯 하였다. 그들의 정신과 신체는 비틀리기 시작하였다.

그들과 같이 위대한 종족에게 결점이 생겼다는 사실과 맞닥뜨리자, 그들은 - 그들의 역사책에서 각주에나 간신히 실릴 정도였던, 마법폭발의 또 다른 피해자인 - 같은 엘프 동족, 샬로레와 탈로레들에게 간절한 지원 요청을 보냈다. 지원 요청은 그들이 하찮고도 연약한 종족으로 여겼던 인간과 하플링에게까지 전해졌다.

날로레를 파괴했던 것과 같은 힘이 그들을 구원하였다. 쉐르'툴의 마법을 통해, 날로레들은 물 속에서 편하게 숨을 쉴 수 있게 되었다. 그들의 몸은 물 속에서 살아가기 위해 적응되었으며, 그들의 다리는 길고 뱀과 같은 모양의 꼬리가 되었다. 이러한 급격한 신체 변화는 보통 공포를 불러오지만, 예상할 수 있듯이 날로레들은 그들의 새로운 몸에서 가능성을 보았다. 그들의 가라앉은 대지가 다시 그들의 것이 된 것이다. 그들의 집은 다시 지어졌으며, 그들의 문명은 다시 태어났다. 날로레는 더 이상 없다. 이 바다 속 왕국의 사람들은, 이제 다른 자들에게 '나가' 라고 알려지게 될 것이다...]],

이 편지가 너에게 제대로 전달됐으면 좋겠군 그래. 최근 우리의 의사소통이 전혀 이루어지지 않았다는 점을 먼저 사과하겠네. 마즈'에이알 대륙을 가로지르는 나의 여행은 너무나 즐거우면서도 또한 위험해서, 편지를 보낼 생각조차 하지 못했다네. 내가 발견한 것을 설명해주면 자네가 얼마나 기뻐할지 알고 있으니, 글의 서두는 이쯤 쓰겠네.

상상해보게. 늑대를 상상해보게. 저 흉폭한 늑대를 상상해보게. 힘 세고, 흉포하고, 고기를 탐하는 저 모든 종류의 하등한 늑대들을 상상해보게. 자네 역시 지역 주민들이 주로 "와르그" 라고 부르는, 늑대들에 대해 들어본 적이 있을걸세.
이제... 방금 전에 상상한 늑대가 곰의 크기를 가지고 있는 것을 상상해보게. 정말로, 데르스 주변을 여행하던 도중 나는 이 괴물 같은, 공포스러운, 늑대 같은 적수를 만났다네. 송곳니는 내 검 만큼이나 길었고, 나는 이 늑대들의 제왕과 전투를 시작했다네. 아쉬운 점은, 그 동물을 사냥하는 것에 실패했다는 것일세. 하지만 내 장담하네 - 그 무시무시한 분노로부터 살아남은 것만으로도 충분히 영광스러운 일이며, 그 명성이 널리 알려져야 할 일일세.

그리고 정말로, 이런 생명체를 죽여 영광을 얻을 수 있겠는가? 나는 실로 어마어마한 숫자의, 털가죽으로 만들어진 신발과 모자를 데르스에서 보았다네. 하지만 전설은 그렇게 허무하게 죽어서는 안된다네. 전설은 이 세계에 영혼을 불어넣어주는 존재니까 말일세!

나는 내가 처음 깨어난 그 순간, 내가 첫 숨을 들이마신 그 순간, 세계에 가득한 신선한 공기가 나에게 활력을 불어넣어주던 그 순간을 기억한다. 나는 눈을 떴다. 그리고 엄청난 빛을 뿜어내는 형체가 서있는 것을 보았다. 그녀는 키가 크고 마른 몸을 하고 있었다. 그녀는 땅에 닿을 정도의 긴, 은빛 머리카락을 가지고 있었다. 그녀의 피부는 밝다 못해 창백한 수준이었다. 그녀의 눈은 별빛보다도 밝게 빛나고 있었다.

나는 그녀를 본 순간, 그 짧은 시간이 마치 영겁의 시간처럼 느껴졌다. 그리고 그녀가 나를 보았다. 나는 그녀의 눈에서 눈물이 떨어지는 것을 발견하였다. 나는 아직 목소리를 낼 수 없었지만, 나는 생각했다. "그녀는 왜 이렇게 슬픈 얼굴을 하고 있을까?" 그리고 나는, 그녀의 대답이 생각을 통해 전해지는 것을 느꼈다. "당신이 아름답기 때문입니다. 아니, 당신이 이 세상에 존재하는 어떤 것보다도 아름답기 때문입니다. 하지만 이 세상은 고통과 슬픔의 세상이고, 저는 제 창조물이 피해를 입는 것을 참을 수 없습니다. 저는 당신에게 오랜 세월을 견뎌낼 수 있는 힘을 줄 것입니다. 원하는 모든 것을 표현할 수 있는 목소리를 줄 것입니다. 하지만 슬픔의 무게가 당신을 평생 동안 따라다니게 될 것입니다. 그래서 저는 눈물을 흘리는 것입니다..."

그 말이 끝나고, 나는 팔다리에 힘이 들어오며 목에서 목소리가 나오는 것을 느꼈다. 나는 땅에서 일어나, 주변을 둘러보았다. 나를 둘러싼 세계와 별들을 보고, 나는 경외와 즐거움에 가득 차 크게 노래를 불렀다. 그녀도 나의 목소리를 듣고, 눈물을 그치고 미소를 지었다. 그래서 나는 그녀를 즐겁게 만들기 위해 잠시 동안 노래를 계속 불렀다. 그러다가 내가 물었다. "저는 혼자인가요?" 그녀는 고개를 끄덕이고, 말했다. "이곳에 당신 같은 사람은 없습니다." 그 말을 듣고 나는 슬퍼졌고, 그녀 역시 내 마음 속에 있는 외로움을 보았다. 그녀는 잠시 망설이다가 입을 열었다. "제게는 고통스러운 일이지만, 당신의 바람을 그냥 보고만 있을 수는 없군요. 이제 잠시 수면을 취하세요. 당신이 눈을 뜨면, 당신과 같은 사람들을 발견할 수 있을거에요. 그들과 같이 이 망가진 세계를, 이 세계를 고쳐주세요."

그녀의 말이 끝남과 동시에, 나는 깊은 수면 상태에 빠져들었다. 정신을 차리고 눈을 뜨자, 나는 세계가 변해있음을 알아차렸다. 하늘에 타오르는 빛이 있었다 - 새로 태어난, 태양이었다. 그리고 주변에 나와 같은 수십 명의 사람들이 있는 것을 보았다. 그 모습은 비슷하지만, 그 성격이나 능력은 각각 달랐다. 나는 일어났다. 그리고 그들을 끌어모았다. 우리는 서로가 존재한다는 사실에 기쁨을 느꼈고, 우리들의 이름을 '알로ㄹ?' 라고 지었다. 하지만 그녀는 사라진 뒤였으며, 그곳에 있던 어느 누구도 그녀에 대해 알지 못했다. 그녀를 찾고자 하는 모든 노력은 허사로 돌아갔다.

시간이 흐르고, 많은 것들이 변화하였다. 다른 생명체들을 찾아냈으며, 그것들은 종종 타락하고 사악해지고 자기들끼리 전쟁을 하였다. 그리고 우리는 쉐르'툴을 발견하였다. 그들은 우리의 아름다움에 기쁨을 표시하였다. 그리고 우리에게 다양한 기술들을 알려주었다. 그리고 전쟁이 시작되었다. 우리들 중 몇몇은 그들을 도와 전투에 참여하였다. 하지만 곧 우리는 그들의 상대가 되지 않는다는 것을 깨닫고, 그 전쟁이 괴멸적인 결과를 가져오기 전에 숲으로 피신하였다.

수 세기가 지났고, 나는 여전히 그녀를 찾고 있지만 성과가 없다. 모든 신들이 사냥당했다는 사실을 안다. 쉐르'툴이 그들의 신성한 전쟁을 치르는 동안, 철저한 탐색이 있었다는 것을 기억한다. 나는 이제 늙었고, 나와 함께 깨어났던 자들 중 몇몇은 죽음을 맞이하였다. 밤이 찾아올 때마다, 점점 더 추워지고 외로워진다. 하지만 지금도 내가 잠에 들면 그녀의 얼굴이 보이고, 그녀의 목소리가 들려온다. 나는 언젠가, 어떻게든, 반드시 그녀와 다시 만날 것이다.]],

	lore = [[Many are the tales of how our world was made, from the absurd to the romantic to the horrific. But they are all mere myths, with no more than seeds of truth to even the most reliable. The history of our race goes back far, but it is tantalisingly scant in details from before we met the other races. Indeed, it is only through our battles with the others that we halflings have any ancient records at all.

The elves one would suspect of having the greatest knowledge of elder times, but they are aloof and silent. One must judge from this that either they do not know, or that the truth ashames them. The latter would certainly not surprise me.

The humans have more myths than they have brain cells. It seems that each village has several versions of their own local tales, usually passed down orally over the ages. It is clear that not a single element of any of their myths can be construed to contain any essence of the truth.

The dwarves are reticent about the subject of how they were made. They say that such talk is "not profitable". However upon further pressing (and bribing) they will open up a little further. They as a race are of the most fervent belief that they were the last people to be made in Maj'Eyal. They say they are the "final product". Their word for all other races in fact translates directly to "prototype". This mostly singular outlook does of course seem absurd, but one need only look at the rest of dwarven society to see that they are an absurd race with ridiculous ideals. If they are what they consider perfection then I thank whatever god made me that I am flawed!

The subject of gods is of course a difficult one. Clearly there are no divine forces at work in the world today. But the world as we know it did not come from nothing, and even the great Sher'Tul clearly did naught more than manipulate the world - they did not make it.

By logical conjecture one can only presume that some great being made the world. This must have been a benevolent being, for it is clear that "He" created creatures separate from himself to walk the earth. Clearly this is we halflings. We are the only race that truly appreciates the world. We do not warp it with magic experiments like the Shaloren, nor hide from it like the Thaloren. We do not bring destruction like the orcs, or petty greed like the dwarves. And our understanding and knowledge is so far advanced than the humans that it is hard to understand why we share the same world with them at all. We were quite clearly the first of the current races to be created, and our natural feelings of entitlement to all there is in Maj'Eyal must stem from this.

Now that this has been clearly analysed in logical terms, one must consider the source of the other races. It is impossible that they were made by the same god - truly impossible. What strange being could create our race, so gifted and rounded, and yet make such warped and twisted creatures as the dwarves and humans? No, clearly other gods were responsible, lesser gods than our own which copied his grand design. But with fudging fingers and inelegant touches the works of their design were clearly far inferior to the subtleties and perfection which crafted us.

However there remains the matter of the Sher'Tul. Clearly these were of greater power than us, and yet they disappeared. One must presume that our god made this race before us, but was somehow unhappy with them, and so removed them and made us instead. We are not as powerful as the Sher'Tul - not yet at least - but we have our own gifts that evidently give us a greater place in our creator's heart. This would explain why we were the first race to unlock the powers of the Sher'Tul farportals. We had a natural affinity to the works of our elder brethren.

So what happened to these gods after they had made the races which we see today? One must presume strife between them, and that they killed themselves, or took their battle away from the world. Our creator, seeing the other gods killed or left, must have then entrusted the world to us halflings, knowing that we would rule over it in his stead. This is why at every point in history we have played a pivotal role in the shaping of our world. It is our rightful inheritance, and it is our duty to rule it well.]],

And One came who made a blinding light called Sun,
But Eyal flinched and said, "It is too bright!"
So Gerlyk spun Eyal around; thus his face was half-time in light and half-time in shadow,
But in shadow Eyal became lonely and cried.

And so Gerlyk made him two younger sisters who danced around Eyal
And kept him in good spirits.
But the moonsisters became jealous of their brother's affection,
Threatening to fight and scream.
Thus Gerlyk separated them so that Eyal would only ever dance with one at a time.

In the summer Eyal dances with the moonsister Altia.
She sings songs of joy and laughter,
And brings friends and family together,
And she glows yellow with mirth.
In the winter Eyal dances with the moonsister Felia.
She tells tales of times begone,
And makes men walk alone in thought,
And she glows blue with solemness.

But in the time between,
When both sisters are slimly seen on each side of Eyal,
Glaring at each other from behind their brother's belly,
Then the world goes still, and the winds hold their breath, and the oceans lie flat.
For this is the Time of Balance, when the Darkness rises deepest, and all life is in peril.
Aye, and Gerlyk did say, "Let no man walk abroad this night, lest Darkness catch him and take him forever."
Aye, and Gerlyk did walk abroad that night, into Darkness beyond, and has ne'er since been seen.]],

Our ancestors found their powers from the intense study of the stars, yet the people these days seem only to care about their applications in battle. I know our position with the orcs is grim, but we must not forget our roots in the celestial sphere! Only by sun, moon and stars do we find knowledge and power in life.

Ah well, I shall at least be able to study here in peace. The ring of invisibility I have crafted affords me cover from any orc patrols, and the caves around the moonstone are quiet enough. I have set up my telescope in the open air of the Valley of the Moon itself.

I saw the red star, and it became a land of fire floating in the night sky, full of black creatures with yellow eyes and hungry red mouths. And beyond the red star, far beyond was a dim world, but fractured and split all about its surface. As the world spun the split continents crushed against each other, and lava spilled up, and lands sunk into the ground. Demonic mouths screamed up as they disappeared into fiery death. It was if the world was tearing itself apart, but some force of will was desperately trying to keep it held together.

And I saw then in the centre of the world, as it spun and crumpled and crunched, a vast figure with a horned head and outstretched limbs and shining white eyes. It held tight to the innards of the world, holding it together against forces threatening to pull the whole planet apart. The giant face contorted and screamed in pain and fury.

“Urh'Rok,” a deep voice spoke within my head. “Our god, our saviour, holder of our world. In the name of Urh'Rok we seek vengeance against Amakthel and the Sher'Tul. The petty world of Eyal shall fall!” And then I woke up, and I felt sure something was nearby, looking for me. I fled instantly.

Am I going mad? The name “Urh'Rok” still rebounds through my skull and my vision is dimmed. Perhaps I have been wearing this ring too long...

	lore = [[I begin my writings with a study of the humans, currently the most populous of the races in Maj'Eyal. The greatest kingdom in number are by far the Cornacs, but mention should also be made of the Sholtar and Mardrop kingdoms, and the Higher bloodline. The biggest human population centre is around the citadel of Last Hope, though many other settlements exist across all corners of Maj'Eyal.

Cornacs are normally around 5'9", with generally dark hair, brown eyes and ruddy features. Most Cornacs take up roles as tradesmen, farmers, or other manual labour jobs. It is a sad fact that the majority of bandit groups tend to be dominated by Cornacs. Cornac families tend to be large, and since the Age of Dusk their population has expanded rapidly, especially in the farming lands in the west and around Last Hope in the south.

Sholtar are generally 5'11", with dark skin, hair and eyes. They originate from the south-east of Maj'Eyal, and are few in number since the Cataclysm tore much of their land into the sea. Their affinity with nature is renowned, and they are often found employed as healers, infusion crafters or wyrmic huntsmen.

Mardrop humans are all but extinct, after the Spellhunt and the plagues during the Age of Dusk. They were known to be powerful spellcasters, and as such were prime targets by the spellhunters. However some trace of them can still be found, as their fiery hair and freckled skin oft can appear in those of distant descent. A few are rumoured to still possess citadels and towers in remote locations.

Highers are on average 6'0", with fair hair and skin and blue or grey eyes. The majority of scholarly roles are taken up by Highers, and they tend to fill most of the noble classes. Some say this is due to discrimination and elitism, though these may simply be jealous sentiments. There are also rumours that the superior intellects of Highers are due to arcane experiments instigated by the ancient Conclave during the Age of Allure, but I have found no records to support this idea and must consider it to be baseless. The Higher bloodline is renowned as a mark of excellence, and mixing with lower bloods is strongly frowned upon.

All human kingdoms were united by King Toknor the Brave in the Age of Pyre, and remain under the rule of his son King Tolak the Fair. A full discussion of the long human history would require a far more detailed document.]]}

	lore = [[There are two main kingdoms of halflings, the Eldoral and the Nargol, though both mix often. All halflings are just under 4' tall, and are generally noted for their large feet and curly hair. Eldoral are usually fair-haired and blue-eyed. Nargol tend to be darker in hair and complexion, with hazel eyes, and oft slightly shorter than their cousins. Halflings are known for their intelligence and quick wit, but also their arrogance in dealing with other races - something they do not deny, for they say it is well-deserved.

Halflings used to be the most dominant race in Maj'Eyal, with control of many strategic Sher'Tul ruins and rule over great swathes of land. The recorded wars between humans and halflings are numerous, and the halflings were the most often victors. However the Age of Pyre brought them great ruin, for the orcs seemed to target them more fiercely than any other race, and many of their communities were wiped out. This has forced them to rely more on trade with other races in modern times, especially with the humans.

The Eldorals used to have a kingdom in the north of the continent, but most of it was destroyed during the wars with the orcs, and not much has been rebuilt. However they do still have many agricultural settlements such as Derth, albeit shared with other races. The Eldoral are known for their great healers and farmers, and their slingers are considered the best in all the lands.

The Nargols once had many strong fortifications in the south of Maj'Eyal, but though they suffered less than the Eldoral in the Age of Pyre they still lost great numbers, and much of their centres of population dwindled. The rise of Last Hope has accelerated this process, as many communities are subsumed into the city's suburbs. Nargols are known as great jewellers, alchemists and rune-crafters, and possess some of the best tactical minds of all the races. Many generals and military advisers are employed from their kingdom.

The most famous of all halflings is Queen Mirvenia, most famed for her saving of King Toknor in Last Hope from a siege of orcs. Mystery still surrounds how she managed to bypass the winter's icy floes with her army to reach the citadel in time to rescue Toknor. Some have hypothesised that she enlisted the aid of sorcerers, but none of her troops would talk about the journey afterwards. She wed King Toknor in the second year of the Age of Ascendancy, and gave birth to the first known mixed race child - Tolak the Fair.

	lore = [[The dwarves are an exceptionally secretive and quiet race, reluctant to talk about themselves to outsiders unless hefty bribes are paid. Many times in their history they have cut off all contact with the other races for no known reason, shutting tight the great iron doors that cover the trade passages to their mines and their cavernous cities. However of late they have become more open with the outside world, and I have even had the pleasure of receiving the unique distinction of being allowed to enter their main city, the Iron Throne, and speaking with several of their guild leaders.

Dwarves are around 5' tall, with generally brown or grey hair. They are usually stocky and muscular, and known to be very resistant to any physical suffering. Their females can be hard to distinguish from their males, but can usually be identified by the beads braided into their beards. All dwarves are highly proud of their beards, and take immaculate care of them. The greatest insult to a dwarf is to belittle his beard, and the greatest sign of suffering in a dwarf is for him to tear at his beard.

Dwarves are known especially for their smithwork and artificing, which is unrivalled amongst all the other races. They also make cunning merchants, known to drive a hard bargain. Their society consists of a fairly strict caste system, with families belonging to guilds of miners, smelters, craftsmen, and so on, and deviance into work outside of one's guild of birth is almost unheard of. However there is no perceived inequality between guilds, with each having equal representation on their ruling Committee of Guilds. Who actually acts as figurehead is unknown to outsiders though, and no amount of bribing will encourage any dwarf to speak on the subject. When it is mentioned in passing their allusions to a leader are normally marked by an almost religious reverence.

Their skill with metal is renowned above all else. Dwarven steel is considered the most durable material for use in construction, and dwarves are the finest workers with stralite and voratun, precious metals of immense value. They trade heavily in their crafts from their capital the Iron Throne, but allow no outsiders in - instead they send innumerable merchant caravans out to all the cities to ply their wares.

As well as the many merchant dwarves one may meet there are also a great deal of young dwarves who venture beyond their halls of stone. These are generally of adventuring fare, and it is encouraged in dwarven society to experience something of the wider world in one's younger years. This is known to them as being "smithed upon the anvil of the world". In private though some senior dwarves admit that this activity is promoted to help with their "market research strategy".]]}

	lore = [[Though the elven races look very similar in appearance, they are extremely distinct in history, culture, mindset and many subtle physical traits, so I shall write of each of them separately. All elves are marked by their long, pointed ears and high cheek-bones, but other features can vary greatly. It should be noted that they call themselves as a whole "Elore", which means "siblings", yet the interactions between these brothers and sisters are oft strained.

Shaloren (or Shalore - lit "siblings of grace") are on average 6'2", with bright hair and blue or purple eyes. They are usually slim and lightly built, more marked for their mental prowess than their physical strengths. They are however known to be extremely swift of movement and light of foot. But of particular note is their magical affinity, which is far stronger than any other race, and their intense powers of will.

The Shaloren have a long history of magic-use which continues to this day. Though other races shun the dangers of magic to a large degree, the Shaloren embrace it, and it is still widely used throughout their society. However they are careful to hide this in their dealings with other races. The Shaloren were the ones that began the Spellblaze, though they would soon have it forgotten, and the memories of blame run deep amongst many. During the Spellhunt in the Age of Dusk they locked their city doors and shrouded the whole region in mist, only coming out in secrecy. It took many centuries before they were accepted again in wider society, and still they are treated with intense distrust.

Their capital city is Elvala, in the south-west peninsula, and they have very few settlements outside of this. They have naturally long lives, and their mastery of the arcane arts has allowed them to extend their lives indefinitely. The eldest immortals make up their Council of Elders, which is headed by their King Aranion Gayaeil. Death is a particular fascination amongst the Shaloren, and early kings of their race were said to build great tombs for themselves whilst experimenting in flesh preservation and necromancy. The Shaloren of course deny this.

They deal with other races seldom, preferring to keep a low profile, and most of their trade is done through halfling intermediaries. A few rune-crafters and enchanters sometimes travel to other major cities to do business, and some brash youths are known to explore further afield.]]}

They are generally of muscular build, and known for their physical prowess. They are renowned to be of a fey mindset - as quick to furious violence as they are to joyous song. Their relations with the Shaloren are particularly strained, as they strongly oppose their brethren's use of magic.

Their capital city is Shatur, hidden deep within the northern woods, and they are loathe to let any outsiders even approach the surrounding forest. Archers and fighters carefully patrol their borders, ready to rain down death from the trees on any who encroach. Their leader is Queen Nessilla Tantaelen, and they are said to live in extensive dwellings carved into giant trees, but little else is known about their society.

Those who choose to leave the fastness of the forest tend to be of unique disposition with unusual attitudes and traits. Oft they are musicians, bowmasters or skilled warriors. However they are sometimes mistrusted heavily, as rumour has it that many of those who leave Shatur are actually criminals expelled for the very worst crimes. In any case they tend to be natural loners who wander the world on their own personal quests.

The Thaloren do business very rarely with the outside world, but when they do it is normally for metals and certain foodstuffs that they cannot get themselves. Usually in trade they sell woodcraft and fine silks. This is the only legal source of elven-wood, a rare commodity that is often sought after for fletchwork. Black market sources rely on poachers to cut trees from the Shatur forest - an immensely risky business, but also very profitable for the high prices paid by Shaloren mages for an elven-wood staff.]]}

However as a separate elf race they are worth studying, scant though the records be. Much of what is now said about the Naloren is traced with myth, but one can deduce certain facts.

Naloren elves were around 5'10", with blonde hair and green eyes. They were incredibly thin, but known for their swift and dextrous capabilities. Their kingdom was located on the eastern side of Maj'Eyal, and all of their towns were on the sea or straddling major rivers. They employed themselves as fishermen, sponge-divers, sailors and musicians. They were renowned for being able to stay underwater for hours at a time, and those with arcane abilities were said to be able to stay submerged indefinitely.

They traded little with the other races, and were very protective of their coastal lands. They most especially guarded jealously an ancient Sher'Tul ruin that lay in the centre of their territories. The Shaloren were in particular keen to study this relic, but the Naloren always refused them access, though they were too afraid to touch it themselves. The orcs were said to encroach on their lands often, but were always fought back by their mail-clad warriors wielding vicious tridents.

Alas their love of the sea was to be their undoing. When the Cataclysm came the whole of the coastal kingdom was shorn away and fell into the sea, annihilating almost the entire race. What small numbers survived committed suicide soon after by leaping from the eastern cliffs into the ocean, following their fallen brothers and sisters. Almost no evidence of their civilisation remains.]]}

	lore = [[The orcs are, joyfully, extinct from Maj'Eyal, following the purge instigated by King Toknor the Brave at the start of the Age of Ascendancy. But an academic study of their previous culture and civilisation is still of interest, primitive though it may have been.

Orcs were generally around 6'1", with green or black skin. They varied greatly in physical appearance and build, most likely due to their exceptionally fast breeding rates. The majority of orcs were thick-built and heavily muscled, well remembered as the stock grunts of their terrible armies. However in the Age of Pyre a greater number of thinner, stringier orcs appeared, oft versed in destructive magics.

The orcs were first encountered by the Eldoral halflings, who tried to use the simple creatures as servants, but gave up after finding them to be too violent. In the many centuries since wars and battles have been almost continuously fought with the brutes. Their oft superior numbers have at times threatened to overwhelm all of civilisation, even leading to such drastic defensive measures as the Spellblaze. The most terrifying time though was during the Age of Pyre, when the orcs developed arcane abilities, and under the leadership of Garkul the Devourer they swept through the continent, mercilessly slaying all before them. In the end 10,000 halflings gave up their lives in the Battle of Nargol to defeat their demonic leader and stem their army's advance. Gradually the civilised races began to recover, and finally King Toknor and Queen Mirvenia succeeded in uniting the human and halfling kingdoms, putting together a force to push back the orcs and ultimately extinguishing them entirely.

Recent investigations of orcish ruins have revealed a surprising amount of cultural material, and even crude artworks based around fertility and battle. Some evidence has also been found of strong community elements to their culture, with much focus on sporting activities and racial pride events. However these are still clearly lacking in the subtleties and aesthetics of our more advanced cultures, and any attempt to compare them with us must be overshadowed by their brutality, territorial violence, and obsession with war.

There have been no substantiated reports of orcs for over 100 years. What reported sightings there are tend to be from such unreliable sources as adventurers and hermits, and have never been verified. We should be thankful that these horrible creatures have been banished to the annals of history, surviving only as stories to be told to misbehaving children.]]}

	lore = [[Ah, the legendary Sher'Tul! How any scholar does love to write about them. Indeed, the texts are many, but the facts are few, as so little is known about this crucible race. The most learned and factual academic on the subject is the renowned explorer and archaeologist Darwood Oakton, but he has alas been missing for several months at the time of writing. I will attempt to summarise here some of his key discoveries.

The Sher'Tul lived over ten thousand years ago, during what is referred to as the Age of Haze. The name of the race we know from the elves, who speak of the ancient beings with awe and reverence, yet know little else about them. Ruins of fantastical Sher'Tul structures have been found all across Maj'Eyal, and some have been observed in sunken lands off the coasts, implying that in their time the Sher'Tul must have ruled unopposed all across the world.

The farportals were first discovered by the halflings during the Age of Allure, and after much experimentation they were found to be able to transport items and creatures over vast distances. The arcane powers behind these incredible artifacts are still far beyond the understanding of the greatest minds of our time. The one attempt to truly tap into these powers ended in disaster - the Shaloren moved all known farportals to a remote spot near their capital, and their most powerful mages were overwhelmed as they unleashed the Spellblaze, killing them instantly and tearing apart the continent. What remains of farportals are left in the world have since been left untouched.

Of their physical appearance we know almost nothing, as there is no surviving artwork or records which depict themselves. However they must have been of similar form to other common races, as their ruins contain stairs, doorways and rooms not unfit for humans. Oakton estimates from his studies of their tools and artifacts that they would have stood around 5'4" tall, with uncommonly long limbs and fingers.

What caused them to become extinct is unknown, though many theories abound. The most popular in academic circles at the moment is that their mighty magics were their undoing, turned upon their own people during some great civil strife. Other theories hold weight though - Archiman Garybald, Professor of Demonic Studies, believes that the extensive uses of arcane energies by the Sher'Tul may have attracted twisted forces from other worlds which wiped out the ancient race. Some even believe that they are not truly extinct, but are in hiding, or have left this world for elsewhere. I fear the truth may never be fully known, but the ongoing study and examination of the relics they have left behind continues to provide immense value and inspiration.]]}

These do not hold any civilised society of note, nor in general do they seem capable of any form of higher thought or culture, but they are still of interest to study for any who take delight in analysing beings of more primitive intellect.

Trolls come in two main types - Kezrak and Moltep, or stone and forest trolls as they are colloquially known. Stone trolls infest many mountain chains to the north-east, and some have been known to wander further afield in search of food or to spread violence. They are generally over 8' high, with extremely pronounced muscular strength and a thick, solid hide which bears the appearance of coal or granite. Forest trolls are generally found in dense woods or swamps, with the Trollmire east of Derth being especially infamous. They have a more advanced form of speech than their mountain-dwelling cousins, and are known to move faster and wield more elaborate weapons, though their greenish hide is not as thick and their musculature less developed. All trolls have intensely fast metabolisms, capable of healing from grievous wounds within a matter of hours. At birth they measure just eight inches long, but within two years grow to full maturity, and rarely live beyond ten years old. They used to be considered little more than beasts, but towards the end of the Age of Pyre many were trained as fighters by the orcs, and were even taught the basics of language and certain battle tactics, making them much more dangerous. Though the orcs are gone their servants remain, and their remote breeding areas and intense birth rates have so far scampered attempts to eradicate them completely.

Giants live mostly around the mountainous peaks surrounding the Daikara Pass. They vary greatly in size, but are normally at least 10' tall. They look somewhat like large, deformed humans, with swollen or distended facial features and much longer, swinging limbs. They live in nomadic tribes, moving from peak to peak with the seasons, feeding on wild deer and goats. They are usually peaceful creatures, only turning violent when their territory is encroached or their young are threatened. There are sometimes reports of giants coming to lowlands and stealing farm animals or attacking communities, but these are rare and normally isolated to particularly harsh winters. Giants seem to have no developed culture or language worth mentioning, but have been noted to show interactions of limited intelligence and to commune well in groups.

Nagas were once believed to be mere myth, but reliable reports and even the capturing of dead physical samples has shown them to be real creatures. The upper half of their body is humanoid in form, with blonde hair and an extremely thin build, but the lower half is like that of a giant snake's tail. They stand around 6' tall on land, though their tails extend several feet further. They have been encountered off the eastern and south-eastern coasts of Maj'Eyal, which seems to indicate some exotic civilisation beneath the waves. Records of them exist only from the last few hundred years, and only more recently have they been interpreted as more than just the wild fantasies of inebriated sailors. They can breathe in air and underwater, possessing both lungs and gills, and have been reported to move with surprising speed on the ground. One might think them simply odd monsters, but they decorate themselves in jewellry and craft weapons and armour from materials found on the sea-bed, such as supple mail formed from layers of thick shark-hide. This would suggest an advanced culture, but communication with them so far has proved impossible. It is not known if they are capable of complex speech, but to date their only response to those who encounter them has been extreme violence, and fishermen in the east are always wary of coming across these vicious creatures.

The origin of Demons is not wholly known, but it is clear that they are capable of intelligence and so I feel the need to describe them somewhat here. It is known that they can be summoned by certain magical rites, and minor demons were oft in the employ of evil sorcerers during the Age of Dusk. The main theory, which is supported by certain studies by Shaloren archmages, seems to indicate that they come from another world than our own, with connections formed through intense arcane energies. It must be a truly terrifying place to host such foul denizens. Demons vary immensely in appearance and power, as much as the creatures of our own world vary. They generally have blueish blood and metallic flesh and skin, which can oft react oddly with our atmosphere - some become wreathed in flames, others release hideous acids or belching clouds of darkness. All seem versed in magical abilities to some degree, and the strongest of them possess truly terrifying powers. Luckily they are exceptionally rare, and seem to be much less common in modern times since magic has fallen out of use.]]}

	lore = [[The common man may scoff at the idea of classifying dragons as an intelligent race, but experienced wyrmics know otherwise. Dragons are incredibly long-lived creatures, with some known to survive for thousands of years. Though in their early life they are of a bestial nature, as they advance through the centuries they gain an ever keener and more developed intellect. The eldest of wyrms are sometimes considered the most subtle and intelligent of creatures in Maj'Eyal, capable of telepathic communication and advanced mental abilities, and wyrmics speak of them with the highest reverence.

Dragons come in many shapes and sizes, normally growing from 5' long hatchlings to 20' long mature drakes, with some of the greatest wyrms growing to over 40' in length. They are generally winged, with large lizard-like maws and sharp talons on both their fore and hind legs. They are often noted for the lustrous colour of their scales, normally representing an attunement to one of the key Elements of Eyal. This attunement is unseen in any other race, and some philosophers believe that dragons predate all other races, being formed as raw representations of the elements of nature at the beginning of the world. However this theory may be borne purely from the fanatical delusions of certain wyrmics who have studied the creatures for too long.

All corners of Maj'Eyal show some trace of different types of dragons. The Daikara Pass and surrounding mountain chains are home to a great number of ice and storm dragons. Numerous sand and red dragons can be found in the western desert and hills, and many have been the reports of gigantic sea dragons in the deepest oceans, especially to the south.

Attacks from dragons on humans and halfling settlements are fairly rare, but when they occur they can be truly devastating. Usually they are to feed on livestock, but now and then come attacks from newly matured drakes, seeking out precious metals and gemstones to build up a hoard. Dragon hoards have become a thing of legend, with the greatest wyrms rumoured to protect literal mountains of gold, but in modern times truly sizeable hoards are rare. The dwarves farmed hoarding dragons almost to extinction in the Age of Allure, and most dragons these days retain only modest treasures in their lairs.

Dragons are regularly hunted for their thick scales and their elementally imbued bones. Dragonskin leather is prized amongst armour-workers, as when properly treated it is both light and tough, and oft retains some inkling of the original wyrm's power. Dragon-bone is highly favoured by staff-crafters for its natural attunement to elemental forces, and is sometimes used by fletchers in the crafting of the most delicate yet resilient bows and arrows. However the hunting of dragons for their skin and bones is greatly opposed by many wyrmics, and there is an increasing market for "naturally harvested" drake materials - those taken from dragons which have died of natural causes. Still, demand for all dragon materials is strong with exceptionally high prices paid, and many are the greedy souls that lose their lives each year at the fangs and claws of these magnificent creatures.]]}

With power beyond compare
And the people poor would not come nigh
His dark and terrible lair

Whilst crops fell dead in drought and blight
And children grew diseased
The wizard dread stole in the night
To pillage what he pleased

But a hero came with shining sword
And a will of solid steel
Not seeking fame or high reward
He followed but his zeal

"From Zigur I come on righteous quest
To battle foes arcane
I will not succumb to magic detest
I will end this evil reign"

And so he rode on pure-white steed
To the warlock's hold
That dank abode of dark misdeed
He entered brave and bold

There battle blazed beyond all sight
Sword clashed with spell
Blood was razed in fearsome fight
Scream followed yell

A beam was cast of arcane pure
Piercing mail and shield
But still steadfast with flesh secure
The hero did not yield

A slash tore through the wizard's cloth
His hat dropped to the ground
From loose grip flew his staff so wroth
Thus fell the mage renowned

Now bare of skin and weaponless
Here lay but a man
No arcane sin could now redress
The blood that freely ran

"Fool warlock dead, you were too vain
To gifts of Nature trust
Your faith instead in tools arcane
Now to Nature you are dust"]] }

However, you are not prepared for the bizarre vision that greets you: instead of land and sky you see only amorphous shapes and varying degrees of light. A strange psychedelic haze permeates the air and otherworldly colors and shadows flicker in and out of your peripheral vision. 
As you begin to come to grips with this strange environment, you realize with horror that you cannot move! Your body feels as if it is completely without weight and try as you may you cannot budge an inch. You experience a sense of Déjà Vu as you recall past nightmares of being paralyzed. That's when it strikes you: you never woke up at all, you're still asleep! This epiphany is only reinforced when you notice a strange phenomenon: mirror copies of yourself are being slowly projected from where you stand and are moving about of their own volition.
They all seem to be focused on something in particular, but what? Just as soon as you set your mind to discerning what your dreamselves are focusing on, you feel it. With horror, you realize that you are not alone here. 
Somehow, your foe has invaded your very subconcious and is attacking you in your dreams. Still unable to move, your lucid mind races on how to handle such an insane and horrible situation. On a whim you concentrate on one of your projections and you find that you can control it. 
Free now to face this nightmare, you turn to find your foe. While you have a sense that having one of your dreamselves destroyed may not by itself be catastrophic, what would happen if several or many are cut down? Unwilling to find out, you resolve yourself to end this offensive intrustion into your mind.]],

#{bold}#53rd Allure, Year 603 of the Age of Pyre#{normal}#

I have done it! My fool of a master said I was not ready for the rites of lichdom, that I would attract undue attention... what utter idiocy. Already I can feel the transformation taking place, and I am certain that this weakness will only be momentary. My master was foolish to leave the Grimoire of Mortality Transcended open and unattended! All I needed was a bone from a magical creature, and as luck would have it, I had found a skeletal corpse of a dragon not far from our tower. The other ingredients were trivial and in possession of my master... surely he will be astounded that I, Zilquick the Eternal, will have transcended mortality!

(Another entry is written beneath this one, in a much more elegant and controlled script.)

Zilquick the Eternal, hah! What an unbearable buffoon, and I am glad his pride was his undoing. The young fool used up the Ruby of Eldoral in creating his phylactery, however; I must acquire a new phylactery for myself. On the bright side, my incompetent apprentice did illustrate why a bone from a creature slain by my own hand is important: the dragon bone he chose had left to fester a mold infection, and the mold somehow infused itself with the bone's inherent magical properties, altering the magical composition of the spell. I do hope whoever finds this note shall kill this "lich" using the most painful means available, and shall deposit him someplace where he is sure to be found.
Oh, look. He is trying to harm me with spells, but all he can manage is a corruption of his own name: Z'quikzshl.]]
