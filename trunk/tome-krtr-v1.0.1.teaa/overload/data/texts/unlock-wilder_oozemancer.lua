[[
The long Nature's hatred of all arcane forces has managed to create Oozemancers as the ultimate answer to archmagi.
You have met and destroyed a corrupted one and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Oozemancer class#WHITE#.

Oozemancer are Wilders, who are at home in the wilds and draw their power from their connection with nature.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Offensive long range nature and acidic attacks
- Inherently antimagic
- Summon various kinds of oozes to your side for a short while
- Use oozes, slimes, mucus and moss against Nature's foes#WHITE#

All Wilder classes use Equilibrium for their powers. It represents their connection to nature. 
The higher it gets the more off-balance they are with it. A high Equilibrium makes for a chance to fail to use a power and lose a turn.
