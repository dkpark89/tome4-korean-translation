These caves are the site of where the Spellblaze began. An ancient Sher'Tul farportal lay buried here, and our ancestors tapped into that power to their destruction. Many of the greatest Shaloren mages stood here, and when the energies beyond comprehension erupted they were all annihilated instantly. It was a terrible loss to our people - such knowledge and power lost forever!

Now the ancient ruins have become overgrown by crystals. Reports say that they grow each year. Could they be alive..?

I must admit that stepping into the starting place of the Spellblaze fills me with immense trepidation. This was where the great destruction began, that tore through our world, wiping out cities, tearing the world apart. And yet look at the beauty here!

Possession... is what it almost seems like. These crystals are not natural. I have broken some down and studied them, and the very structure of the material seems vastly distinct from any other I have seen. I have even studied Sher'Tul relics in the Academy and this is most certainly something different. Truly fascinating!

There are dark crystals here which seem to posses some new, destructive element - a very twisting of the nature of the other elements, warping them into malign designs.

Why have I never seen this before?! I must study it, I must understand it - I must comprehend its very nature and hold its power in my own hands... The thirst for knowledge is all-consuming!

I shall name this new element "blight".]],

And from outside that fabric... something else, something truly powerful, trying to force its way in. I feel I can almost reach out and touch it! Such awesome power it is... could this even rival the renowned powers of the Sher'Tul?

The crystals are a corruption of the elements of Maj'Eyal. These outside forces are changing the very make-up of the matter of our world. This cavern is truly a garden of delights, a font of growth and energy. Who knows how far this garden of wonders could spread if we encourage it more? Perhaps the whole of our world could be enveloped in this scintillating glory, a grand corruption for all Eyal!

I have begun to train myself in controlling this "blight". It takes much energy, draining my very vim, but I can feel the tremendous power behind it. I must tap into it more...]],

There is a wonder here, a wonder beyond all else I have ever seen. A crystal of amazing intricacy and beauty, with a halo of power that echoes of the original energies of the Spellblaze. All the power that our ancestors unlocked, mixed with the glorious corruption that it triggered. What beauty - what tremendous beauty!

I felt it touch me, I felt it reach into my heart and imbue me with its strength. I stood entranced as its energy flowed into me. Oh how the blood now courses through my veins! Blood corrupted with true power!

I see now the path that lies before me. The Spellblaze was not a curse, it was a blessing. I must open our people's eyes to the glory that our race has unlocked! I shall bring the wonders of this corruption to the whole world!]],

The council has seen fit to allow me to investigate the scintillating caverns after that Rhaloren madman started raving on the streets about how someone had "befouled" them... I do not see any such befoulment, but neither do I see the moving crystals this place was rumoured to have. There are oddly misplaced crystal shards, which seem to have sheared off of something larger, but hardly anything spectacular.

#{italic}#2nd Summertide, Year 122 of the Age of Ascendancy#{normal}#
It's strange, really.. from the fragments I've been able to find, they seem to adhere to the ethereal geometry of magics - the red fragments seem to be pieces of fire magic from their geometry; the blue adheres to water, etc... there also seem to be pieces of deformed crystal, as though some terrible power warped whatever colour some of these crystals used to be into something they were never intended to be - is this the "befoulment" the madman raved about?

#{italic}#3rd Summertide, Year 122 of the Age of Ascendancy#{normal}#
Well... that was certainly unexpected. There may be some truth to the rumours that these crystals can move about, or at least that they have some will of their own - I was just about to finish my investigation of the caves, when in the very last part of the cave I hadn't yet explored, I saw what appeared to be two giant... legs, growing from the cavern. I was immediately overcome by feelings of fear and malice, and not my own - that crystal sent them to me, that I was unwelcome here, that it was not yet finished. I dare not tell the council of my cowardice, so I shall... invent a more fitting report in a much safer place. If some wayward adventurer finds these notes, it is my surmise that whomever destroyed the original crystals left such a strong impression of strength and will that the rudimentary intelligence governing them decided the form of its destroyer was stronger than the original, crystalline shapes.]]
