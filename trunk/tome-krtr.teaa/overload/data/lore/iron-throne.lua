The rumours you have heard are true. It is with a heavy heart that I confirm one of our mines, Reknor, has been overtaken and inhabited by a large and organised orcish force. How there could be such a decisive and total failure on our part to stop this threat remains a mystery - the source of the orcish invasion remains unknown. A battalion of soldiers will form a defensive perimeter around Reknor until a force to retake the mine and exterminate the orcs can be mustered. All civilians residing within the surrounding halls are to be evacuated.

This is a grave and unprecedented issue, so I decree an oath of silence to be laid upon all citizens of the Iron Throne, regardless of class and station: NO NEWS OF THIS INVASION MUST REACH FOREIGN EARS. We must maintain an image of stability and strength with the Allied Kingdom, as any signs of weakness or internal strife would be catastrophic to our alliance and future trade agreements. Any citizen found divulging this information to any outside party will be punished with exile. Rest assured, I will personally send messages to those outside the Throne who can be trusted with this information, and I trust this orcish intrusion shall be dealt with swiftly and decisively. So speaks the ruler of the Iron Throne, long may our empire endure.]]

Some miners saying they feel ill, hrm hrm. The drem fools have likely been gorging on too much mead. Will deduct it from their pay, yes yes!
