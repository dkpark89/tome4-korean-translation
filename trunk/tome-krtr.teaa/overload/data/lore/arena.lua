#YELLOW#Kill enemies before the gates close #WHITE#to raise your score multiplier!.
#YELLOW#Kill several enemies at once or very strong enemies #WHITE#to please the audience and increase your rank!.
#YELLOW#Collect gold #WHITE#to increase your score and resources at the end of each round.

#YELLOW#Take advantage of the trap at the center of the arena!
Good luck!
