	lore = [[Dear Father,

How glad you must be to hear from your "renegade" son. Do not worry overmuch; I keep myself and my group well hidden from your petty Council. I know how you fret about your status amongst those fools.

I write to you to tell you that I have discovered something wonderful. In all my travels I could not have imagined a place so perfect as this. It is a remnant of the Great Spellblaze, a scar in the very fabric of Eyal. How beautiful it is! Ah, and what strength lies here too! You cannot possibly imagine, sitting idly in your little hall of stone.

You are wrong about the Spellblaze, of this I am certain. Seeing this has opened my eyes fully. The success of our ancestors cannot be denied! The power unleashed was tremendous, and still it lasts, 2646 years later. So much power still remains, untapped! You ramble on about the destruction it caused, but I cannot help but think you are exaggerating about the deaths. And were not the orcs also defeated? The grand purpose was achieved. Oh, you prattle about the plagues and blights, but I have seen how those dirty humans live, and those halflings in their grimy holes. Pestilence is rife amongst them. Besides, it seems clear to me that a little help from natural selection can only serve to improve the lesser races. Indeed, I have done some experiments which show just that. But alas, I think with your short vision you would only be disgusted by my advances.

My Rhaloren have come far in the world, and we have learned many things. Oft we have had to flee the terrible Ziguranth and their Death Wilders, but we have pulled through by force of will and grown stronger every day. Here our pilgrimage ends, for here is where we shall truly come into being. You should hear the voices here, screaming from the other side. You should hear their glorious cacophony! The Spellblaze is almost complete; it only needs our gentle push to bring everything to full fruition. The walls between worlds have been worn thin here, and with my strength we can break through to realms of power beyond belief. Such power I shall have! And with it I shall rend forces through this broken world that shall make the Spellblaze seem a happy memory. Eyal will be put to right, and our mighty place restored at the head of all other races! For the Rhaloren this shall truly be the Age of Ascendancy. For the lesser races, herewith comes their Age of Torment.

As I write to you our final plans are in motion. Sleep well when you read this, for it may well be your last night before the Great Torment begins.

With passionate detest,
Your disobedient son]],
