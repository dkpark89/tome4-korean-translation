"Waverider Tiamel reporting. Immediate perimeter is secure, though I have sent some members to scout the surrounding areas. I will feel better when we have mapped the land and are ready to sustain a larger team. Still, we should be perfectly safe as long as the landdwellers do not know of our presence. And even if they dare come here the magics of Zoisla will put their puny star worship to shame.

"I fear that some of the team are not taking our mission seriously. Do they not know the responsibility the Saviour has laid on us? We are his arms and tails in this far land, and it is our duty to protect the farportal which will help bring us to greater strengths. We are his first line of attack against the blood relatives of those who doomed our race so long ago. And with our efforts we shall push forward our race to new boundaries, laying the path for the bright future our great Saviour has planned for us. Long live Slasul! Long live the legend of the Devourer!"]],

"My fellow nagas! I do not envy you on your journey so far from our great Temple. But you have been chosen for a glorious mission, to establish a new outpost for invasion against the landwalkers. These are the cousins and descendants of those who abandoned us and left our race for dead. Whilst we have hidden beneath the waves for centuries, they prance about worshipping the sun! Well, their nightfall comes soon, and the dawn will rise with us as rulers of land and sea.

"Do not despair that we are attacking this outpost instead of the orcs. My stratagem is carefully planned, and the Sunwall is too great a threat to my designs to be allowed to stand any longer. The orcs... will have their uses in the short term. But be assured, when our time comes there shall be none who can stand as equals against us. Our greatness cannot be quelled or submerged! Our long history of suffering will finally bring forth redemption!

"Your immediate mission is clear, my friends. Ensure the farportal is correctly set up and secured, but take care, as the Sher'Tul magics used are still experimental. Then scout out the area and begin to fortify the surroundings, but do so in secret. When your job is done well I, your humble leader Slasul, shall be honoured to join you on the front line. Until then, swim safely my brothers and sisters, and do not forget our glory."
