Where are the rest of my party? Have my friends abandoned me?]],

	lore = [[I fell into a trance, I know not how. Were it the rich blossoms or the oppressive heat? I swooned into the grass and the mists swirled over my face, playing out fantastic shapes before my eyes. Dancing ladies strode across the skies, and a row of dwarves stood laughing as their beards flew into the wind. Then I felt a Shadow near, and the ladies scattered and the dwarves in terror screamed, their mouths yowling and spilling black petals. I tried to move, but I couldn't, and frozen in fear I saw the Shadow above me, looking down upon my countenance. It grunted and lurched away. I passed out then, and have just recovered.

I am not sure what to make of this. I wish to leave, but I do not know the way. Only by escaping this mist shall I have a clear view of the land. Yet each path seems to wind unexpected, each step takes me closer to the centre, not further. I must make haste from this place.

	lore = [[I have found a body, a fellow Thaloren by the looks of things. Her face was contorted in horror, her limbs twisted into painful shapes. Yet there was no blood, and I see not how she were felled. Was it the Shadow? I have buried her as best I could.

There are strange things in this land, and I am afeared. I saw a large ant earlier, and when I tried to stomp it underfoot it screamed at me, and called me names. I crushed it, and its eyes went red and burst, and it let out a shrill death cry that still echoes round my skull, scattering my thoughts.

My head aches, and with each pounding the earth visibly shakes beneath my feet. Is this a fever? I must get out of here!]],

	lore = [[Another body, if one could call it that. Mangled remains strewn about a rocky outcrop, of whom I know not. Only the armour and weapon give tell that it were once an intelligent race. The breastplate still polished and undented, the axe still clean and un-notched, yet the flesh ripped apart like shredded paper. What could do this?!

I did not even attempt to bury the remains. I ran, and as frightful thoughts filled my head the sky turned red and the earth turned black, and spiders appeared with morphing faces. They laughed at me and spun their webs. I tore through them, the strands sticking to my fingers, mucousy remnants dripping over my skin. A surge of revulsion pulsed through me and suddenly the webs evaporated and the spiders coalesced into a giant face, its mouth a red flower. I reached into the midst of the crimson petals and it exploded in a wet mess, blinding all sight and thought.

I woke up with my flesh drenched in blood. Or is it blood? Is it my flesh? The ground rumbles with my every moan, the mists swirl with my every sigh. I am closer to the heart of the caldera now. Closer to finding the truth. The truth of this place. The truth of myself...]],

I am here and here is me, a reflection of my will. Is it my will any more? Perhaps I am the reflection, my actions inspired by the mists about me.

My dreams follow me as I wake, and wake as I follow them. I seek them and summon them and play with them. This is my playground now. Whatever I dream shall appear, and when I am tired I discard of them, rend them away.

Others want to disturb my games. They come as hawks and moths and snakes, and their mouths spill putrescence over my blessed soil. But let them come. I will play with them. We shall have a fun game together, I think.

And what I think is what is real.]],
