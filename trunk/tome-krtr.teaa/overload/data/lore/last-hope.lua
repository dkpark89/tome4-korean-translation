The orcish tribe have routed us. We have retreated to some Mardrop ruins and secured ourselves amongst the fortifications. I have just shy of 2,000 men under my banner, some of the best warriors I have ever served with, but we are simply no match for the numbers we face. Counting them is difficult, but I would put a minimum estimate at 10,000. The tribe has camped a league away - they seem to be waiting for reinforcements. This does not bode well...

I have sent messenger crows to all the kingdoms. I can but hope they send aid in time.]],

Five men tried deserting last night. Today I had them flogged in front of all the others. I have given warning that any future deserters shall be hanged. These are measures I do not like to take, but harsh times call for harsher discipline.

Our supplies are holding steady for now, but I fear they may not last. I've received word that it will take at least fifty days to muster a force that can save us. Alas, food may well be the least of our worries, for the orcs have begun to attack our strongholds. Thankfully we have had time to reinforce the existing structures. Indeed, little work was needed, for the foundations of this place are strong. My loremaster tells me it was abandoned following the Crimson Pox, but was once the capital of Mardrop. The men have taken a fondness to the place, and have named it "Last Hope". Though I normally discourage such romantic notions I cannot help but feel the same. These stone walls give strength to my heart - I feel we can fight through this.

Their attack has begun again. They seem to have mages now. Ah, it will be a long night...]],

Rations low. Men demoralised. Winterhaze wind is making conditions unbearable. The fortress is holding, but each night they pick off some of our troops. It is but a matter of time before we no longer have the strength to resist.

I can hear their blasted trumpets again. Accursed swine! We have no rest or sleep, not the slightest sojourn without their braying, howling, jeering, taunting, insufferable cantations! It is driving me from my wits! But I must remain strong... I must put on a brave face for the men. They are relying on me, and though the burden feels close to crushing me I must bear it with the dignity of a king.

It is getting dark again. Who will die this night? I am so very afraid... but I cannot show it...]],

Oh, happy days! Joyous retribution! From the jaws of defeat we have been saved, and never before have I felt such elation!

Last night as dusk approached, the orcish armies began to prepare a major attack. My men were ready, for I was determined that if they were to have our lives they would pay for them thrice over. But as the sun waned in the western sky I saw what looked like a rain of gold falling amongst the orcish troops and suddenly they were in disarray. Another flurry came and I saw that it were not gold, but bolts of steel reflected in the setting sun. "The halflings!" my scout shouted, and lo I saw then it was indeed a large army of halflings come upon the orcs' flank.

The orcish army suddenly forgot about us, turning upon their new enemy. But foolish is any who ignores the wrath of a caged lion which sees its chance for vengeance! I led my men immediately into battle, taking the enemy swiftly from the rear, and throwing their organisation into madness. When the halfling army came upon their flank it was a massacre, and we drove them mercilessly towards the southern lake. There upon the shores we beat them to the last number, and their blood stained the water a horrific black.

Our victory sealed, I immediately met with the halfling leader, and found it to be no less than the princess Mirvenia! Truly words cannot express my joy when I saw her face flushed red in the last embers of the setting sun. I almost felt... no, I should not think such things.]],

We have solidified the defences at Last Hope and received more troops from all of the kingdoms. Our tactical position near the sea is proving an excellent base for further attacks on the orcs. I hope to expand our facilities here much further. I am drawing up an alliance now with the other leaders, for only together can we hope to beat this terrible threat to all our kingdoms.

Mirvenia has been key to the discussions and the plans. She is a tactical genius, and I am constantly amazed by her wealth of knowledge and skills. There is an odd woman that accompanies her though, with long fiery hair and a silken robe - Linaniil is her name. One of my men swears he saw her riding into battle in a blaze of flames, burning all the orcs before her. The idea of a spellweaver in our midst is unsettling, but Mirvenia says I should trust her. And if Mirvenia says so then I must believe her.

She is a remarkable force for good, Mirvenia, popular with all the troops. I feel my normal iron rule smoothed by her presence. Too long have I led the cold life of a soldier... alone...

Ah, the beating of my heart cannot be silenced. I must speak to Mirvenia, and tell her how I feel... I only hope she shares some inkling of my emotion.]],

Why is it only in times of darkness I turn to my journal? Today has been the darkest day in over two years, but it could have been darker still.

Mirvenia's convoy was attacked by a rogue band of orcs. Though the brutes were repelled she was hurt in the conflict, and her labour brought on early. She lay before the halls of death for many hours. It is only thanks to the skill of her people's healers that she and the baby survived.

The baby... our baby. My son! Mirvenia is still recovering, but the boy seems hale as any freshly-born child. But still I worry... How I wish that he were born into a more perfect world. How I worry for my wife and child in this age of suffering. I want to make a new age for them, free from such threats as almost took away the woman I love. I want to give my son the chance to reign in an era of peace.

Too long have we been content with repelling orcish raids and pushing back small tribes. Last Hope is now a gleaming city, and a focal point for all the armies of the west. Now is the time for us to drive forward and root out every orcish colony on the continent. I will not rest until Maj'Eyal is free from their vile influence, till every accursed brood is burned to ashes and every pig-spawn orc is cast from existence. I shall end this terrible Age of Pyre and usher in a new Age of Ascendancy! This I do solemnly swear.]],

	lore = [[#{italic}#A study into Southspar's most unusual ruler.#{normal}#

Chances are you haven't heard of Southspar.

And why would you have? It was naught but a tiny, provincial island kingdom off the coast of Tar'Eyal that existed within the Ages of Allure and Dusk. By all accounts, Southspar was a pleasant place to live; temperate climate, healthy trade relations with mainland human kingdoms, and by great luck, the island upon which the kingdom sat held great deposits of the much-valued metal stralite.

Despite this good fortune though, Southspar was doomed to mediocrity. Why? The actions of its ruler. By all accounts a bumbling, octogenarian dotard, his name lost to the mists of time, this mouldy monarch mismanaged Southspar almost to its demise. The Dwarves of the Iron Throne, having heard of the stralite beneath the island, manipulated the king into mining it and selling it to them for a fraction of its true worth. Also, despite Southspar's decidedly puny military power, the king saw fit to send whatever troops he could muster to aid mainland human kingdoms in their great and many wars against the halflings, who up to this point had barely registered Southspar's existence. Not only were the undertrained, ill-equipped troops crushed like vermin before the superior halfling forces, but also these foolhardy attacks succeeded in attracting the halflings' attention to their secluded island. Almost immediately, the raids began.

From what records remain, the king was mystified by the decline of his nation, believing to the end that every action he took had been the right one. He passed away soon after the halfling raids began. Whether it was suicide, assassination, or simple old age is unknown. The king never married and had no children, the only remaining member of his family being a distant cousin, a young man named Drake.

And so it was that Drake ascended to the throne, and Southspar entered a golden age.

#{bold}#1. Drake and the Halfling Horde.#{normal}#

To the newly crowned Drake, the most obvious and immediate threat to Southspar was the growing raids and sorties being held by the halflings. To this end, he ordered a complete and total reconstruction of Southspar's military, turning them from a ragtag bunch of militia into a small yet devastatingly efficient engine of war. Drake knew that the only advantage his forces held over the halflings was their knowledge of the island, and so bade them to travel stealthily, carry small, armour-defeating stralite knives rather than spears and swords, and only engage with the halflings strictly on their own terms. Southspar's newly assembled "Army of Rogues" was a success. Although the halflings were great in number, strike after surgical strike from Drake's army weighed heavily on their morale, and finally, grumpily declaring Southspar "not worth the bother", the halfling forces withdrew.

Southspar celebrated its peace and it's newly found military might, but for Drake, the celebration was short-lived. The stralite he had used to craft his Army of Rogues' knives and armour was stralite that wasn't going into the Dwarves' pockets, and they were far from happy. Drake formulated a plan - by the time he was through, the Dwarves would be even further from happy.

#{bold}#2. Drake and the Stralite Stratagem.#{normal}#

The Dwarves have always been a secretive race. Even now only a select few know the location of their "Iron Council", and in the days of Southspar there were still those who considered Dwarves nothing but myth. Being a monarch in possession of large amounts of stralite can open even the most concealed of doors, however... Drake had requested an audience with the Iron Council, and the Dwarves, expecting said audience to be a humble apology and promises of further stralite for the gold they were paying, readily accepted.

What they got, in reality, was quite different. Gone was the ineffectual king of Southspar's past, and now the Dwarves found themselves facing a young, hard-eyed human who was demanding that the amount of gold that the Dwarves were paying for Southspar's stralite be increased twenty-fold.

To say the Dwarves scoffed at this would be an understatement; open, derisive laughter hits nearer the mark. Despite Southspar's recent repulsion of the halflings, the Dwarves of the Iron Throne saw no problem in taking Southspar's stralite by force. In his heart, Drake knew they could accomplish this, and it was to this end that he had brought the small pouch around his neck to the Council.

Drake held the small, drakeskin pouch high, opened it and emptied its contents onto the floor: Stralite, ground to dust, muddied with dirt and base metals, made unusable and worthless. The Dwarves of the Council gasped in horror at this waste, one (if rumours are to be believed) even fainting on the spot. Drake went on to say that, if his demands were not met, the entirety of the stralite beneath his island would meet the same fate as the stralite cast upon the chamber's floor.

By the time Drake left the Iron Council, the Dwarves had agreed to pay thirty times the previous amount.

	lore = [[#{bold}#3. Drake and the Conclave Mages.#{normal}#

With its borders unassailed, ands its coffers rapidly filling with Dwarven gold, many believed that the fortune of Southspar could not increase any further. Drake, however, had one last task to accomplish, and it regarded the Conclave.

For a long time, a small number of Conclave mages had made their home in Southspar. The remote location and the doddering nature of its old king meant that they could perform experiments and practice magic that would have been disallowed on the mainland. Being reclusive by nature, only a few of their group had heard of the rise of the new king, and none of them had cared much. Drake's royal guards breaking down the door of their study, followed by the king himself, gave them cause to care. Drake had for them an ultimatum:

"This is the kingdom of Southspar, my kingdom, and so everything within her borders must be within my control. This applies to her people, her land, her resources, and now her magic. I shall allow you to remain here in Southspar on one condition: You become members of my royal court, obey my commands, and use your magic for the betterment of the kingdom. When un-needed you may tend to your Conclave matters as you will, but your greatest loyalty will be to me. Do you accept?"

The Conclave mages' response? Laughter. But this laughter was not the mocking laughter of the Dwarves, but laughter of disbelief. As recorded, the mages' response went as:

"King Drake! You needn't have bothered us with such a stern ultimatum! A simple request would have sufficed. True, in the past we may have chosen to reside here for simple seclusion, but it is hard to ignore Southspar's rising star. This kingdom's glory shall continue to grow, and we want to be a part of it. We accept."

Freedom from halfling attacks, Dwarven fortunes, and now the magic of the Conclave blessed Southspar. What, the common people thought, could possibly happen next?

Mere weeks after the Conclave joined the royal court, Drake fell ill and died.

#{bold}#4. Drake and the Empty Throne.#{normal}#

Drake was dead, and Southspar's people were struck with depression and outright horror. Their king, who was fast on his way to making their kingdom one of the greatest in Maj'Eyal, was no more. The throne lay empty; not a single soul vied for the now vacant position of king. As far as Southspar's citizens were concerned, it was Drake's throne, nobody else's.

The norm in tales like this would be that the kingdom slowly managed to get back on its feet, recover from the loss of their king, and finally return to a state resembling normalcy. Not so for Southspar. Drake's demise had left a wound that was not healing, and it was clear that something had to be done. One of the men closest to Drake in his life, his chancellor, left abruptly on a mysterious "errand", hoping that the kingdom would not crumble before his return. After a period of some months he did return, and his first port of call? The study of the Conclave mages. He held in his hand a tome, bound in skin and marked with blood-red runes. Its subject matter was obvious: Necromancy. The chancellor had but one command for the mages:

"Bring him back."

#{bold}#5. Drake and the Pale Kingdom.#{normal}#

Here, sadly, definitive facts on Southspar and Drake's fate vanish. Some say that Drake's rebirth was a resounding success, and Southspar's star continued to rise as the now skeletal Drake retook the throne, the gaze from his exposed skull unchanged from his mortal visage. Others believe that the madness that grasps those returned from the grave took him, and with the new powers that the Conclave had blessed him with began a reign of terror that drowned Southspar in blood. The only fact that can be known for certain was the new name his subjects gave to him in his death: Pale King Drake, the Pale King, or simply Pale Drake.

I leave you with a copy of one of the last pieces of Southspar's history, a partially destroyed scrap of parchment, supposedly written moments before the Cataclysm and Southspar's destruction, falling beneath the waves along with the rest of Tar'Eyal.
