Skeletons, you have been getting noticeably behind in your adventurer slaughtering quotas. The next skeleton archer I see drinking coffee and chatting with the wights shall be rent limb from limb and fed to the orcs. Also, as a punishment for your general laxness, 1,000 skeletons shall be remanded down to Kor'Pul as punishment. A further 250 shall be slaughtered. These orders to be carried out by myself tomorrow at 3am.]],

All hail your brilliant Master. Would you like to walk in the sun? Would you like to be free to roam green meadows and crush innocent children? Such are my wishes also. The reward to anyone who brings me any item that will help me bend this sta... item to my will shall be stupendous.

Also, any new minions who have magical research skills are wanted. Recruit them and you shall be rewarded. Though if they steal my secrets, your blood will be my wine and your heart my appetizer.]],

I began my long unlife as a foolish pipsqueak such as yourself. Why, there was a time before I had conquered even a pit let alone a level or a dungeon. Now, behold all that is Mine.

You must have aspirations. I am not content with just the rule of Dreadfell. No, soon I shall have more. Much more. My boots shall tread the surface of the earth! I shall explore and destroy the most beautiful mountains. All shall be mine once I can walk in the sun once more. Where will you be? Do you wish to be more than the wight I stepped on yesterday? I shall need great leaders to guide my armies across the land.]],

However, he was great and had the chance to be greater still. He let himself be cooped into a small hellhole and was destroyed when the right hero invaded it and destroyed his plaything. Now he is but a mere shade of his former glory.

I shall not make this mistake. Be ready, for soon we shall march out upon the lands. Soon we shall conquer as even he could not. Pity the fool who thinks he can keep me stuck in even the grandest of pits, Dreadfell.]],

To the rest of you, there will be punishment. An adventurer got down to my bedroom and surprised me. I, Myself, was hurt and almost had to use My special power. All is well now and I am as dangerous as ever, but you shall suffer for letting him get so low. The next minion I see shall be toasted with my marshmallows. Where then were the special pits of doom I organized? Where were the poisons of my wights or the diseases of my ghouls? Indeed, I should slaughter all of you, and I would, but those who were most foully remiss were already slaughtered by the adventurer. The rest of you? Beware My wrath.]],

Rather lovely I like to imagine! You were a valiant opponent, and though you were little threat to me I do like to honour you with this special treatment. And you do like honour, don't you? I know you wished to honour your people by defeating me and destroying my tower, but I'm sure you realise now that it was a rather vain endeavour.

I apologise for what happened to that lovely suit of plate. I know it got a little... worn... during the treatment. But I'm afraid I really did need to find out the locations of your companion, and certain pressures had to be applied. You weren't very talkative, now were you? But I soon made you sing, oh yes. Of course, I could have just used a little divination magic to find out what I wanted, but I do so enjoy a good torture... And my, how joyous your screams were whenever the acid splashed against your beard! Hoh, we did chortle, did we not? But no matter, I've had my best skeletal smiths work on fixing your armour, fit to be worn by my new champion.

I hope you enjoy your new work. Approach it with gusto, that sort of thing. I know in life you always dreamed of being a mighty hero of legend. But, well, what can be more glorious than this? You will live forever as my servant, destined to defend my throne for all time! You will be the envy of all the lesser ghouls that shamble about my halls. Well, until you get slain by some dumb intruding adventurer, of course... But that's the beauty of you heroes - one comes in, makes a mess, and then I get a new plaything to toy with. I wonder who shall replace you, eh?

Until then, do enjoy the work, try to keep the place clean, and remember - I own you forever.

I don't blame you for falling for me, you know, even to the point of betraying all your companions just for me. Women have always had a weakness for my brooding personality and sparkling wit. Even in life I was quite the charmer, and death only improves things, I assure you. I really do have the reputation as a heartbreaker, in more ways than one... Your heart shall now sit in a special place, next to the rest of the offal in my pits.

Thank you for telling me of Borfast's weaknesses - it shall make overcoming the dwarven grunt all the simpler. Your rogue friend remains more elusive, but he will be found and destroyed. You see I have a sort of persistent bloody-mindedness about this sort of thing. There is not a cockroach in this tower that does not obey my every whim and will, and I shall see to it that it remains that way.

You must feel a little betrayed of course. I promised you power beyond your imaginings, and instead I drained your blood, fed your flesh to my servants, and enthralled your soul to my bidding. Well, we all struggle to manage expectations sometimes, eh? At least be glad I let your tortured essence roam the cold fastness of my fortress, haunting anyone foolish enough to invade. And some power I will impart to you, and it is indeed beyond your imaginings, for your mind could never reach the dark places I can. But open your eyes now, for such dark places shall be with you till the end of time... Welcome, indeed, to the dark place of my heart.

Well, perhaps to you it was a life and death struggle, but for me this past three weeks of patiently hunting you through my halls has been the most entertaining of past-times. I have enjoyed extending the game so, letting you escape my clutches when I felt it most prudent, watching as you got ever more desperate. Alas, you have now degraded too much, and it was simply too embarrassing watching you eat your own faeces to survive. I had to put an end to it - I'm sure you understand.

But ah, it's not truly an end, for you get to experience the wonder of undead enslavement! Is it not most exciting? Do your bones not quiver with delight? It is just your bones now, since I have a certain fondness for skeletal servants, but I have been nice enough to pad your heels with leather so you can still sneak about quietly. How you did love to sneak! Now you may spend an eternity doing so, ensuring any future trespassers get quite the surprise wandering through my great keep.

I have let you keep your little sling, since I know you like to play with it. Such a quaint weapon... But this staff I found in your possession - my, what a treasure you have brought me! I do not know whence you stole this artifact, but you clearly were completely unaware of its value or power. It has a history beyond your very comprehension, and in my hands it shall change the future! Thank you kindly, my servant; already you have served your Master well. I'm sure we shall enjoy a great friendship over the many years to come. Well, not friendship exactly - it more involves eternal agony on your part, and a rise to ultimate power and majesty for me. Such is the fate of the weak and the strong, a lesson you have already learned well. What a great teacher I make...
