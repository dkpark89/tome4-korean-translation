	lore = [[It were some years now since twain of our brightest students left Angolwen, sullied by our veil of secrecy and our silent duty. It still lies heavy on mine heart to think of what they could accomplish within our private circle. I but hope that one day they whilst return, and they whilst understand the reasons behind our solemn mission.

But I must think of the future, for too many are the regrets of mine long past, and to hold their burdens overlong is to be crushed. I must think of ye, young acolytes, who start now in the learning of our lores. I must explain to ye our mission, our purpose, our justification, so that ye understand all what we do and why. In secrecy we operate, trying to heal the harms of our past, trying to build a better future. For our penance is great, and never should it be forgotten in all Eyal the terrors of the Spellblaze.

I should know well, for I were there. But a young mage was I, though not without promise. I knew of the Shaloren mages' experiments on the Sher'Tul ruins. Aye, and I were jealous of the powers they sought to unlock. No fear or caution had I in my arrogant youth, thinking only of opportunities and glory. Heed well that thought...

Two thousand six hundred cycles of the Sun have passed above my head, and yet still I cannot shake the memory of the day the sky turned to flame and the earth was torn to shreds. I felt the magic in the air, the sudden unleashing of arcane energies beyond anyone's control. I knew in an instant that the Shaloren had unlocked the power of the farportals, but the forces were far beyond their expectations. I saw within seconds the streams of blazing energy tear through the sky above our heads, and then rain down in crimson plumes of destruction. It was all I could to put a shield about myself, and the burns I suffered were terrible, such that scars remain to this day. No one about me survived. Still I remember mine sister Neira's shortened scream as she stood beside me, her skin flayed off by the terrible energies, her body consumed by a pyre of flames, her ashes strewn by a great tumult in the earth. Twenty-six centuries have passed and still I do wake to the sound of that scream...

Many were the loved ones I lost that day, and I were not alone. Countless perished across the lands, and countless more died in the chaos which followed. Then the Spellhunt began, and the people rose against the arrogance of the mages and began slaughtering us mercilessly. After the Spellblaze our abilities were in disarray, our mana channels sundered. We were nigh defenceless, and it took great effort to gather many of us together and found the hidden city of Angolwen. A great many mages were killed in the riots that followed, aye and many innocents too, for distrust was rife and the thirst for blood all-consuming. But alas, the suffering did not end there.

The effects of the Spellblaze can still be seen today, in tortured lands and blighted earths. In the Age of Dusk it were much worse. New diseases arose, plagues swept across all cities, civilisations brought to nothing. All our races came close to extinction, and an age of darkness came upon all learning and enlightenment. Feudal lords and bandit gangs fought amongst what little healthy lands were left, whilst the blights continued to ravage what free people remained. That was when I did begin our secret missions to repair the world, to make right the errors of our actions. In silent operation we visited the broken lands and used our powers to heal, not to destroy. Many centuries it took, but at last the aftereffects of the Spellblaze began to diminish, and the people began to rebuild.

Ah, how much hope was in me then. But foolish were I to think it could be so easy. The wounds of Eyal struck deeper than mere diseases on the surface. The poison went down much further, and the cracks tore through the very roots of our world. One dark and stormy day a great cataclysm swept forth from the east, and the land rose 500 leagues into the sky. We could do naught but gasp in horror as whole cities, whole races were swept into the sea. The continents were sheared apart and all of Eyal forever changed. It was a sight to humble even the greatest archmage.

Aye, and humility is what I teach to ye now. Know ye well that there are forces out there which dwarf ye into insignificance. Know as well that they have no glory, no pride, for they are forces of ultimate destruction which bring only terror and pain.

Our mission is to help the world. Our penance is to act in secret. Old wounds remain and new threats do arise, but all must be dealt with from behind our cloak of silence. The mistrust of our ilk still lies deep in people's minds, and there are even those who hate us with a violent passion. But the world is changing, and perhaps one day we shall be accepted again in society. Until then remember well this lesson of humility, and in the open world keep ye secret, and keep ye safe.]],

#{italic}#A study by Archmage Tazimar Tarelion#{normal}#

How uncouth and common a question it must seem, and yet it is the one I am asked most often, even by some of our most learned students. Too often we teach The Art by practise and imitation and concentration on the end effects, without teaching in greater detail of the underlying principles. Just as a musician may merrily play on his harp without knowing how the sound arises from the vibration of the strings, so a mage may make use of magic without realising the true forces at work. In this document I hope to give learning on the nature of magic, and how the underlying effects give rise to all the wondrous fruits we can produce.

Alchemists will tell you that the world is made up of many base materials - lead, copper, iron, gold and so on. They are fixated on splitting things down into these components and investigating how they react with each other. However there is more to the world than this. Certainly they represent the physical make-up of things, but they do not show the forces and energy that bring everything into motion. The forces of fire, cold, lightning and life itself are all very real effects, and these we call the Elements of Eyal. The true archmage is interested in the interactions of the elemental forces of the world, and manipulating them to his or her need.

The elemental forces exist naturally in the world, and are weaved around all things in an all-encompassing canvas. They move, vibrate and resonate with the materials of the world, and the effects of each play heavily on one another. All creatures naturally make use of these elements, and some are more attuned to these threads than others. With great training and practise we can become more attuned to these wild forces ourselves, and in so doing some can match the speed of wolves, the strength of bears, the tenacity of treants and even the immense natural powers of dragons.

But there is another way of gaining access to these elemental forces - a more direct way, though some would call it unnatural. Long ago people discovered with much training how to concentrate their wills to pluck the elemental threads directly. This can release great energies, and these can be shaped to produce real effects in the world. Plumes of fire, bolts of lightning and blasts of ice can all be called forth by those suitably trained. The true masters of magic can go much further, combining many resonant forces to create complex physical effects.

The tapping of threads can be a draining task, requiring much effort of will to sustain. This is what we versed in the arcane call "mana", that mental stamina dedicated to the interaction with the elements of the world. Continual use of magic is like the constant lifting and holding of heavy weights, and eventually one will find one's capacity drained. Practise allows one to build up greater pools of mana, and certain runes and spells can gradually build extra reserves to be called upon as needed.

Magical runes and items are imbued with an attachment to certain elemental threads. This requires delicate work by experienced and gifted enchanters. The most intricate of magical artifacts demand many years of work, using intense mental effort to permanently attune the core materials to the right elemental energies. Gemstones are especially easy to work with in this craft, and alchemists use them often to bring about elemental effects.

Some believe that magic is inherently wrong, that the so-called twisting of the elements with one's will can only lead to terrible things. As students of Angolwen I assume you disagree! Magic is simply an extension of the forces of nature, and are we not natural creatures that use it? But remember that magic is still a powerful force that can be used for good or ill. Magic is indeed a tool of immense value - use it wisely.

	lore = [[From the desk of Archmage Varil,
Another day dawns on Angolwen. I hesitate to write this, but it almost feels as if peace is once again returning to Eyal. Saying this, I almost expect war and destruction to erupt immediately - fate is anything if not spiteful. Regardless, my sleep grows less disturbed by my memories of the Spellhunt day by day, and I can now devote myself wholly to the betterment of our cloistered community here in the mountains.

This is not to say that life has been without conflict at all. An agent of the Ziguranth infiltrated Angolwen under the guise of a travelling alchemist a few days ago; an unhappy first, I'm afraid. Having used choking powder to incapacitate the guards and rob the surrounding mages of their voices, things may have turned ugly if Linaniil hadn't been passing by on one of her walks. Little was left of that man... or the tree he hid behind... or many of the surrounding buildings, to be honest.

In a way, the incident lit a fire under me to pursue my studies and develop my powers, but I must admit that my interest in staff practice has waned as of late. My fencing, on the other hand, improves by the day. Hmm... I wonder if I can get some of the enchanters to help me "augment" my old sword. After all, what is a blade but a sharpened metal staff?]],
