return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Mindslayer (Psionic)",
[[Mindslayers are the frontline fighters of the yeek's Way. Absolutly devoted to serving the Way, and thus all yeeks, they dive into battle with nothing but their own mind.
Yeeks are natively psionic and thus most of them are yeeks, but psionic powers do happen - rarely - in other races too.

You have saved a fellow yeek mindslayer and can now create characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Mindslayer class#WHITE#.

Mindslayers use their powerful psionic powers to supplement their low physical strength and dive into battle.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Erect psionic shields around you both for protection and to absorb energy
- Engulf yourself in psionic auras - unleashing pain to all those near you
- Use your psionic "third hand" to hold a second weapon, floating in front of you
- Unleash the power of your sustained auras and shields by spiking them in great bursts of power#WHITE#

Mindslayers use their mind to manipulate the world.
They require energy to do so, which they take from the world around them.
While their shields are up incoming damage will be partly absorbed and the energy stored for later use.
