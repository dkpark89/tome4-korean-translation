return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Marauder (Rogue)",
[[Some rogues live by strength rather than cunning, relying on vicious attacks instead of stealth and subterfuge. These bandits maraud the land, lightly armoured and wielding dual weapons, taking what they can by force.

You have learned the value in causing sheer damage in combat and can now create characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Marauder class#WHITE#.

Marauders are highly mobile rogues with a range of dextrous techniques and tactics at their disposal. Class features:#YELLOW#
- Move with ease around the battlefield, dancing around your foes and avoiding their attacks
- Wield dual weapons and unleash devastating techniques on your opponents
- Rely on pure thuggery to cripple your enemies before taking them down#WHITE#

Marauders use stamina to fuel their techniques, which replenishes slowly over time.
