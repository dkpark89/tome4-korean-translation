return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Wyrmic (Wilder)",
[[
Some people, either through training or magic, can take on the defining aspects of the dragon-kin themselves.
You have consumed a magic that allows you to gain such a power. You can now also create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Wyrmic class#WHITE#.

Wyrmics are Wilders, who are at home in the wilds and draw their power from their connection with the dragons.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Take on the aspects of fire, cold, and sand-drakes
- Breath weapons: fire, ice, and sand
- Powerful two-handed melee combatant#WHITE#

All Wilder classes use Equilibrium for their powers. It represents their connection to nature. 
The higher it gets the more off-balance they are with it. A high equilibrium makes for a chance to fail to use a power and lose a turn.
Wyrmics are also trained in the martial arts and use stamina for some techniques.
