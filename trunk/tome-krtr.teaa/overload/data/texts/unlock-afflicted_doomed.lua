return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Doomed (Afflicted)",
[[Through ignorance, greed or folly, the Doomed served some dark design and must now pay for their sins.
Their only master now is the hatred they carry for every living thing.
Drawing strength from the death of all they encounter, the Doomed become terrifying combatants.
Their mere presence engulfs the area in darkness.
Some of them, however, strive to redeem their faults by using their Doomed powers to battle evil.

You destroyed your own doomed shadow. You can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Doomed class#WHITE#.

Doomed are short range spellcasters.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Engulf your foes in darkness
- Summon shadows to fight for you
- Unleash your hatred in raw physical form
- Feed off the life of your foes#WHITE#

The Doomed use hate, a resource that grows as they kill their foes and decreases while standing idle.
Most of their talents are more effective with high hate.
]]
