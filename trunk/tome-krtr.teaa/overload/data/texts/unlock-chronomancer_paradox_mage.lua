return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Paradox Mage (Chronomancer)",
[[Time isn't a linear thing, it only appears to be.  In truth it's a fabric, the very fabric that holds the universe together.
Some seek to weave this fabric, to bend it and shape it to their own will.  Only the truely dedicated or the truely mad manage to unlock the secrets of time and space.

You have learned such secrets and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Paradox Mage class#WHITE#.

Paradox Mages are non-traditional spell casters who use chronomancy to reshape the universe.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Control the flow of time around you
- Bend and manipulate the timestream or even pull yourself from the future
- Manipulate space and gravity to smash your foes to pieces or keep them in place
- See into the future or even travel into the past#WHITE#

Paradox Mages use Paradox for their powers.  It represents how much damage they've done to the spacetime continuum.
The higher their paradox the greater the effect of their powers but the harder they'll be to control.
