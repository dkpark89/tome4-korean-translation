#LIGHT_GREEN#Welcome to ToME 4!#LAST#

This tutorial will present you with a short quest to familiarise yourself with the game.
You are a Human adventurer sent into the forest by the local village to dispose of the "Lone Wolf".

This tutorial character is more powerful than a normal starting character and has infinite lives.
A normal character has limited lives, and once you run out, you stay dead (unless you found or accomplished things that allow you to resurrect).

During this tutorial you will be guided by dialog boxes such as this one, explaining how things work.
Dialog boxes can be dismissed by pressing Escape or clicking outside of their zone (or on the title bar).

Now close this dialog to proceed.
