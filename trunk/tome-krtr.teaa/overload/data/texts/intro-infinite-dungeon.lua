return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You have arrived in the Infinite Dungeon.
Your life outside did not satisfy you, so you came here looking for adventure.
While you know this is a one way trip, you hope to go in a blaze of glory!

Go forth, venture into the depths of the dungeon and see how far you can get before the end.
