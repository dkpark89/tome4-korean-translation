return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You are of the Thaloren, the Elven race closest to nature. Your people have lived for thousands of years in their forest, rarely taking part in the events of the outside world.
Yet when their home is threatened, the Thaloren Elves can prove to be fearsome combatants.
You lived a peaceful life deep in the forest for many years, but lately you have grown restless and have decided to step into the world.

You have decided to venture into the old and wild places looking for ancient treasures and glory.

You have come to the western side of the Thaloren forest, to the lair of Norgos. Norgos was a steadfast ally of the Thaloren, protecting the western border. But lately he has grown corrupt, even attacking the Thaloren.
To the east of Shatur, the Thaloren Capital, lies a dark part of the woods. Ever since the Spellblaze this area has been corrupted. The wildlife there has been transformed.

After days of travel, you have found Norgos' Lair and entered it. What will you find there...?
