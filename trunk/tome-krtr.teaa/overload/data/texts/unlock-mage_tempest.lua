return "New Talent Category: #LIGHT_GREEN#Storm",
[[Since the dawn of time mages have experimented with the elements.
While most mages are content using the Air school, a few of them took their research deeper and created Storm magic.
At its core lies the Tempest, a storm so powerful it can even damage creatures normaly immune.

You have mastered storm magic and can now create new Archmage characters that can learn the #LIGHT_GREEN#Storm talents#WHITE#.

Talents:
- #YELLOW#Nova: #WHITE#Unleash of lightning nova around you, dazing and damaging creatures caught inside
- #YELLOW#Shock: #WHITE#Fire a fast bolt of lightning, dazing the target
- #YELLOW#Hurricane: #WHITE#Call down a Hurricane on any creature you daze, creating a lightning storm around each of them
- #YELLOW#Tempest: #WHITE#Master the Tempest and pierce even through lightning immunities
]]
