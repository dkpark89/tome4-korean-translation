return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Brawler (Warrior)",
[[The ravages of the Spellblaze stretched armies thin and left many unprotected. Not everyone could afford the luxury of a weapon.
Without steel or iron, poor communities of all races turned to the strength of their own bodies for defense against the darkness.
These unarmed techniques still exist today.

You have learned these techniques and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Brawler class#WHITE#.

Brawlers are warriors who fight with little more then their own bodies as weapons.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Build deadly combination attacks with your strikes
- Wear gauntlets or gloves to boost your damage
- Outwit your foes and set them up for deadly counter attacks
- Control your enemies and break their bones with fierce grappling techniques#WHITE#

Brawlers use stamina and must remain at least semi-mobile.  As such they can not perform their unarmed talents in massive armor.
