return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
As you walk forward, you hear the increasingly loud cheers coming from outside.
As you step into the arena, the scorching sun blinds your eyes temporarily.
You look up, and meet your target eye to eye. The Master of the Arena, carefully examining

Determined to win, you draw your weapons and advance defiantly. 
The public roars in anticipation....
