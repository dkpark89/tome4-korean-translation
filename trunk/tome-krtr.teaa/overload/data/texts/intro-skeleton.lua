return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You died ages ago, but that did not stop you. You were raised as an undead skeleton.

Your Necromancer master has plans for you, but something is wrong: you seem to have kept your free will.
Get rid of this evil mage and try to find a place in the world.

You have been raised in a place called the Blighted Scar, on the northern border of the Shaloren lands. Escape this forsaken pit and try your luck in old forgotten places.
