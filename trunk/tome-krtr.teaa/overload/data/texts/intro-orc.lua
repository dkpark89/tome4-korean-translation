return [[Welcome #LIGHT_GREEN#@name@#WHITE#.
You are a member of the feared race of the Orcs.
BLAH BLAH BLAH

You have been sent to a remote island on the southwest coast of the Far East to crush an outpost of the Sunwall, the last remaining bastion of men, elves and dwarves on this continent.

A little to the south lies the outpost. Your task: destroy it and bathe in the blood of its people!
