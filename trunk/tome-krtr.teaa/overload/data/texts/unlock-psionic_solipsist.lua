return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Solipsist (Psionic)",
[[Solipsists are powerful psionicists that believe that the world is made up of nothing more than the thoughts and dreams of those that live in it.
This power does not come without a price however, and the Solipsist must constantly fight with their own ego in order to keep a clear view of reality, lest they fall into a state of solipsism, the belief that the world and those that live in it is nothing more than a figment of thier mind.

You've experienced the power of dreams first hand and may now create characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Solipsist class#WHITE#.

Solipsists use the power of thought and dreams to manipulate the world around them.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Distort the fabric of reality
- Store and discharge psionic feedback
- Summon powerful warriors birthed from your own consciousness
- Convert damage you take into Psi damage and keep yourself alive with your mental reserves
- Put your foes to sleep, enter their dreams, and become their worst nightmare#WHITE#

Solipsists use their mind to manipulate the world around them.
They require energy to do so, which they recover naturally over time and through methods others use to heal the body.
