return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Summoner (Wilder)",
[[
In the wilds, some people and creatures are able, by the sole force of their will, to call upon allies to help them in combat.
You have witnessed such an act and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Summoner class#WHITE#.

Summoners are Wilders, who are at home in the wilds and draw their power from their connection with nature.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Summon allies, ranging from a war hound to the mighty fire drake
- Take direct control of your summons
- Augment your summons with various powers#WHITE#

All Wilder classes use Equilibrium for their powers. It represents their connection to nature. 
The higher it gets the more off-balance they are with it. A high Equilibrium makes for a chance to fail to use a power and lose a turn.
