return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Necromancer",
[[
Necromancy, the forbidden art.
Necromancy, the black art.

During the Age of Dusk and the Age of Pyre the world went through a tortured era. Kingdoms were shattered, whole races suppressed, and diseases ran wild, killing millions.
It was a dark time and amidst the chaos came the bringers of terror. The necromancers.
Though they always existed, and will always exist whilst our souls are open to temptation, this was their true age of glory.
The so called 'noble' archmages regard necromancers as fallen brothers that must be corrected... or removed. But necromancers consider themselves misunderstood, practitioners of an art that others are too scared or too feeble to touch. And oh, what great powers those arts do bring...

You have learnt the basics of necromancy, killed a real one and can now create new characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Necromancer class#WHITE#.

Necromancers are dark spellcasters, attuned to death itself. Their ultimate goal is their own eternal life, often as a Lich.
Class features:#YELLOW#
- Cast darkness and ice infused spells to destroy your foes
- Summon an army of undead minions to do your bidding
- Use your minions of pawns, sacrificing them in various cruel and unusual ways
- Embark on the quest of your life: Lichdom#WHITE#

All mages use mana to cast their spells.
It slowly replenishes over time.
