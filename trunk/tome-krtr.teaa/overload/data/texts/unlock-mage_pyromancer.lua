return "New Talent Category: #LIGHT_GREEN#Wildfire",
[[Since the dawn of time mages have experimented with the elements.
While most mages are content using the Fire school, a few of them took their research deeper and created Wildfire magic.
At its core lies the Wildfire, a fire so hot it can even damage creatures normaly immune.

You have mastered wildfire magic and can now create new Archmage characters that can learn the #LIGHT_GREEN#Wildfire talents#WHITE#.

Talents:
- #YELLOW#Blastwave: #WHITE#Unleash a fire nova around you, damaging and knocking back anything caught inside
- #YELLOW#Dancing Fires: #WHITE#Project your inner fire to all creatures in your line of sight, setting them ablaze
- #YELLOW#Combust: #WHITE#Disrupt normal burning effects and make them combust at once
- #YELLOW#Wildfire: #WHITE#Master the Wildfire and pierce even through fire immunities
