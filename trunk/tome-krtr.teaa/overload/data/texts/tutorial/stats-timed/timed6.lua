return [[
This is fairly close to saying that you knock a turn off the duration of timed effects for every five points that your defensive #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# score beats the attacker's offensive #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE#.

There are some subtle differences, however.

As you may have noticed earlier, your #LIGHT_GREEN#Spellpower#WHITE# of 56 against an orc's #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE# of 70, despite having a difference of only 14, resulted in a three-turn duration decrease. This is because the orc's score of 70 gives it 14 turns of duration reduction, but your score of 56 only undoes 11 of those turns, resulting in a reduction of 3 turns.
