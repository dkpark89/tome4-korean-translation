Try the new spell on each of the enemies in the next room. Note that it's a spell, so it uses your #LIGHT_GREEN#Spellpower#WHITE#, and it causes a physical effect (bleeding), so the target will defend with its #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE#.

Note in particular the duration of the effect on each enemy. You can check their tooltip to see detrimental effects and their remaining duration.
