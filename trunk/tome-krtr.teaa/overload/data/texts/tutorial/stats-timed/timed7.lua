In general, greatly reducing the durations of timed effects requires rather high defensive #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# scores. The all-important #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# score difference of ten that we saw earlier usually results in a mere two-turn reduction of timed effect durations. 

If you want to negate timed effects completely, you're going to have to work hard at finding sources of #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE#, #LIGHT_GREEN#Spell save#WHITE#, and 
#LIGHT_GREEN#Mental save#WHITE#.
