It looks like there are quite a few ways to match up the offensive #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE#...
#LIGHT_GREEN#Accuracy#WHITE#
#LIGHT_GREEN#Physical power#WHITE#
#LIGHT_GREEN#Spellpower#WHITE#
#LIGHT_GREEN#Mindpower#WHITE#

...with the defensive #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE#.
#LIGHT_GREEN#Defense#WHITE#
#LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE#
#LIGHT_GREEN#Spell save#WHITE#
#LIGHT_GREEN#Mental save#WHITE#

But don't worry. It's usually easy to know what will get used for two reasons:

#GOLD#1)#WHITE#  Defensive #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE# are used quite consistently; physical effects use #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE#, no matter their source. Magical effects use #LIGHT_GREEN#Spell save#WHITE#, no matter their source. Mental effects use #LIGHT_GREEN#Mental save#WHITE#, no matter their source.

#GOLD#2)#WHITE#  For the most part, any given class uses a single offensive #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE#, so there's not much potential for confusion. A berserker will only be using #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical power#WHITE# to apply effects. Similarly, an archmage will only use #LIGHT_GREEN#Spellpower#WHITE#.
