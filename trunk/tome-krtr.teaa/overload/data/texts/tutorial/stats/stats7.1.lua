Finally, suppose you're a rogue, and you use Dual Strike to attempt to knock somebody senseless. 

As with the berserker example, first you must hit, so you compare your #LIGHT_GREEN#Accuracy#WHITE# to the target's #LIGHT_GREEN#Defense#WHITE#.

We can guess now that the target will use their #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE# to attempt to shrug off the stun. But what will you use? You're not getting the job done with raw muscle, like a berserker. You're doing this with finesse, so we'll use your #LIGHT_GREEN#Accuracy#WHITE#.
