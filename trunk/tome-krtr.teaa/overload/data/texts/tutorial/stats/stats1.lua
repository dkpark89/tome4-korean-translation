Basic character attributes such as strength and willpower are important, but their importance lies in how they affect your #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE#, the subject of this entire tutorial.
The first two of these #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE# are:

#LIGHT_GREEN#Accuracy: #WHITE#Determines whether your physical attacks hit your target.  
#LIGHT_GREEN#Defense: #WHITE#Your ability to avoid attacks.

When you try to stab somebody, your #LIGHT_GREEN#Accuracy#WHITE# score is measured against your target's #LIGHT_GREEN#Defense#WHITE# score, and a percentage chance of success is determined. We'll look at the exact calculation later.
