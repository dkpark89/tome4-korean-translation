return [[During your adventures you will find quests.
A quest can come from performing an action, finding an item, speaking to somebody, and more.

You can view your current quests by pressing 'j' or right-clicking yourself.

Once a quest is finished or failed it will disappear from the quest log. Most quests in ToME are optional, if you don't think you can survive one, don't do it.

When this tutorial started you were tasked to kill the Lone Wolf, you are nearing its position.
