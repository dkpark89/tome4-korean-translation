return [[You have found a nest of snakes! If you let them surround you, you might be in trouble!
A basic tactic is to never get surrounded, do not hesitate to backtrack a bit to a safer spot.

#GOLD#Always control the fight.#WHITE#

After the combat you will probably be low on health, you can rest for a while to regain lost health and resources.
Either press 'R' or right-click on yourself to rest. You will rest until fully restored or until a creature disturbs you.

Now take a few steps back so you only have to fight one snake at a time, and you should survive.
Remember to use your talents, infusions and runes to win the fight.
