Some clues:

1) #LIGHT_GREEN#Defense#WHITE# is 20 and #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical Save#WHITE# is 21, yet they have different colors and positions.

2) There seems to be no overlap in positions. The 21 is entirely to the right of that 20, for example.

3) Each display scale is ten characters long, and each score takes up two characters.
