Armed with the knowledge of how important #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE# are, we now go in search of them. Yours are displayed to the left, right under the minimap. Once you've closed this window, you can move your mouse cursor over them to see a brief description of what they do. The tooltip mentions some stuff we haven't covered yet, but we'll get there.

So what about seeing a monster's #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE#? This would hardly be a dungeon without creepy denizens; there's an orc ahead you can examine. Use the mouse or the 'l'ook command to examine that orc.
