game.player:forceLevelup(2)

return [[In ToME4 a character's power depends on her/his level: players can get up to level 50.

Each level brings more life and resources (like stamina, mana, etc.) and different kinds of points that can improve your character:
* #GOLD#Stat points#WHITE#: They allow you to raise the six main stats: Strength, Dexterity, Magic, Willpower, Cunning and Constitution. You get 3 points per level.
* #GOLD#Class talent points#WHITE#: Class talents define the core functions of your class. You gain 1 point every level, plus 1 extra point on multiples of 5.
* #GOLD#Generic talent points#WHITE#: Generic talents provide utility and/or more power, but are not always specific to your class. You gain 1 point on levels that aren't multiples of 5.
* #GOLD#Category talent points#WHITE#: They allow you to improve your mastery of a talent category (increasing the power of all talents inside) or to learn a new talent category.

Levels are gained when experience reaches 100%. You gain experience from killing a hostile creature whose level is similar to yours.

To open the character levelup screen either press 'shift+G' or right-click on yourself.

Now open the levelup screen and assign your points.
