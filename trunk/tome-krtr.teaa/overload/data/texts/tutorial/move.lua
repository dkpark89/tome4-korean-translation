return [[Movement is simple. You can use the keyboard, the mouse, or both.

#GOLD#Keyboard:#WHITE#
- Press the arrow keys or keypad to move in the given direction.
- Press shift + the arrow keys or keypad to run in the given direction.
- Press 5 on the keypad to stay put for a turn (doing nothing).

#GOLD#Mouse:#WHITE#
- Click on a spot on the map to move there.
- If there are no monsters and the way is known you will run there.
- If there are unknown or interesting grids along the way you may stop.
- If there is a hostile creature in sight you will only move one grid per click, to prevent stupid deaths.
- Clicking on yourself will make you stay put for a turn (doing nothing).

You can scroll the map by pressing shift and click+dragging with your mouse, or pressing "L" and using shift+the movement keys.

Now close this dialog and go west (left) until you arrive in a bigger area.
