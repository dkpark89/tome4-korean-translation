return [[#GOLD#Congratulations !#WHITE#

You have completed this small tutorial, and should now know the basics of ToME4. You are ready to step forward into the world to find glory, treasures and be mercilessly slaughtered by hordes of creatures you thought you could handle!
During this tutorial some creatures were adjusted to the need of the teachings, beware, in the real world trolls are not usually this nice!

If you need a reminder of which key does what, you can access the game menu by pressing #GOLD#Escape#WHITE# and checking the key binds (you can also adjust them to your needs).

As this is probably your first time with the game you will find there is a limited number of races and classes available to play, many many more do exist but you will unlock them while playing.

Now go boldly and remember: #GOLD#Have fun!#WHITE#
Press Escape, save & exit and create a new character!
