Have you determined what's causing those new timed effects?

If not, then consider the following questions:

1) What #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# are you using as the attacker, and what #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# are the spiders using as the defenders?

2) What tiers are these #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE#?

Feel free to go batter those spiders some more if you need further experimentation!
