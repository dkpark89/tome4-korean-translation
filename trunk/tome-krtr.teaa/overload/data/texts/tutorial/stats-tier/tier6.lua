return [[
These new effects are #GOLD#cross-tier effects#WHITE#. They occur when a talent calls for comparing #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE# that aren't in the same tier. 

Physical effects cause the "Off-balance" effect.

Magic effects cause the "Spellshocked" effect.

Mental effects cause the "Brainlocked" effect.

The effects last one turn per tier difference in the attacker's and defender's #GOLD#combat stats#WHITE#. For example, casting Mana Gale with a #8d55ff#Tier 5#WHITE# #LIGHT_GREEN#Spellpower#WHITE# on a target with a #B4B4B4#Tier 1#WHITE# #LIGHT_GREEN#Physical save#WHITE# would result in applying a four-turn "Off-balance" effect.
