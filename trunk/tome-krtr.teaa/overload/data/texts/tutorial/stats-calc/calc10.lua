Congratulations! Hopefully this series of obstacles has led you to some conclusions:

1) When comparing #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# scores, a difference of ten is the magic number that maximizes success.

2) Comparing roughly equal #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# scores results in a success about half the time.

For the purposes of this tutorial, the maximum success chance is 100%, which will mostly not be the case in the proper game-- but a difference of ten points is still what you're shooting for in order to hit the max, whatever it happens to be.

You might also have concluded that this simple "win by ten points for best results" rule means that maximizing success becomes harder and harder when comparing higher-tier #GOLD#combat stat#WHITE# scores. True enough!
