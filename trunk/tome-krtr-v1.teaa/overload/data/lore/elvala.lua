#{bold}#제 1장: 운명적인 만남#{normal}#

내가 아직 어린 시절이였고, 젊은 생각과 젊은 나이가 사람들에게는 아직 부담스러웠던, 매혹의 시대에 이 이야기는 시작되었다. 이 이야기는 당시 많은 종족들에게 닥쳐온 비극들과 영웅적인 이야기들의 주인공들이 한데 얽혀있는 연대기이다. 비극적인 사실은 영웅이란 이름으로 포장된 나의 어리석은 행동에 대한 이야기만을 들려줄 수 있다는 것이다. 세상을 놀라게 했고 우리의 역사를 송두리째 바꿔버린 위력적인 힘: 마력폭발 말이다.

우리의 젊은 지도자 에피니아스가 칼'크룰의 지도자를 만나던 날, 나는 리나니일을 회담에서 처음으로 만났다. 우리 도시의 문으로 거대한 남자가 들어오던 순간을 기억한다. 우리쪽 사람들은 그 남자의 허리 둘레, 뻣뻣한 수염, 가죽옷과 위풍당당한 걸음걸이를 지켜보았다. 우리같이 호리호리한 엘프들 사이에서 그가 얼마나 어색해보였는지... 몇명은 그를 야만인이라 생각했지만 나는 그의 얼어버릴듯한 눈동자 뒤로 엄청난 힘을 느낄수 있었다. 그는 강인한 종족의 남자였다. 그 종족은 한때 에이알의 북쪽에서 살았으며, 겨울만이 계속되는 하늘 속 일렁이는 초록색 불에서 힘을 빌려온다는 종족이였다. 그의 이름은 투르셀이였고 수세기동안 대지나 눈을 밟아본적이 없는 자였다. 그의 오른손에는 빛나는 황금의 고리가 불타는듯한 루비를 장식하고 있는 마즈'에이알의 위대한 인간 마법사 연합의 대표를 상징하는 칼'쿠를의 반지를 끼고 있었다.

그에게는 그를 따라걸어오던 두명의 딸, 리나니일과 네이라가 있었다. 두명은 보기에는 닮은듯 했지만 나는 둘의 성격이 정반대임을 깨달았다. 둘은 모두 선홍빛 머리카락을 길게 땋고 태양에 비치는 파리한 피부를 가지고 있었다. 모두 실크 로브를 입고있었지만, 네이라는 노란색과 오렌지색을 입은 반면에 리나니일은 파란색과 은색의 로브를 입었었다. 네이라는 스쳐만봐도 밝은 인상에 활기찬 목소리를 가지고 엘발라의 안뜰로 들어가기 전까지 지나쳤던 모든 장신구들에 대해서 조잘거리고 있었다. 반면에 리나니일은 매우 조용했다. 굳은 얼굴로 자신이 바라본 모든 것들에 대해서 냉정한 평가를 내리고 계산적이였다. 하지만 나는 차가운 외모속에 불을 볼 수 있었다. 아니, 그건 폭발과 같았다. 분출되길 갈망하지만 자제하고 있는 불타는 열정말이다. 그들이 성체로 다가오는 짧은 순간에 우리는 눈을 마주쳤다. 나는 그녀가 가진 절대 정복할 수 없는 힘과 의지를 가진 거친 영혼과 누그러뜨릴수 없는 생각을 지켜볼 수 있었다. 숨이 멎을것만 같았다.

우리들중 극히 소수만이 어떻게 우리 종족이 사람에게 푹 빠질수 있는지 이해하고 있었다. 그러나 그들은 리나니일을 알지 못했다. 내가 그녀에 대해 아는것만큼 아는 사람은 없었다. 마치 기름을 만난 불처럼 그녀는 감정과 욕망이 불타올랐다. 그녀의 열정은 반대를 용납하지 않았고 그녀의 지혜와 언어로 주변의 사람들을 매혹하거나 복종시켰다. 여름날의 태양처럼 밝게 빛나지만 여전히 차갑고 그녀 본인이 닿길 원하지 않는한 닿을 수 없이 멀게 느껴지는, 그녀는 아름답고 밝게 빛나는 존재였다. 이 모든 시간이 흘러도 그녀는 결코 변하지 않았다.

성문을 지나면서 네이라가 나에게 따뜻한 인사를 건냈음을 겨우 눈치챌수 있었다. 리나니일은 단지 퉁명스럽게 고개를 까닥일뿐이였다. 우리의 지도자와 그의 손님들이 대회랑에 들어와 자리를 잡자 나도 따라들어갔다. 회담은 쉐르'툴의 원거리 관문의 힘을 이용하고자 우리 대마법사의 작업을 돕기 위해서 새로운 계획을 시작하기위한 것이였다. 고대 종족의 유물들이 손대지 않은채 대지 밑에 오랫동안 잠들어있었다. 그 유물로 얻을 막강한 힘으로 오크와의 전쟁을 빠르게, 결정적으로 끝낼 수 있을터였다. 그들은 마력폭발이라 불렀다. 우리가 경외와 숭배로 부르는 이름말이다.

에피니아스 왕은 손님들을 소개하고 주변 사람들을 소개하면서 회담을 시작했다. "이 사람의 짐의 장군이라네" 나를 가르키며 말했다, "샬로레 군대의 사령관 가야에일이지." 그 즉시 리나니일이 나를 바라보고 얼이 빠진 표정을 지었다.

"뭐라구요?" 리나니일이 나의 갑옷과 칼집을 보며 외쳤다. 리나니일은 주인은 신경도 쓰지 않는듯 우리에게서 등을 돌렸다. "아버지, 이게 무슨 뜻이죠?" 리나니일이 건장한 남자에게 물었다. "아버지께서는 샬로레에 가장 강력한 전투마법사가 있다고 하셨잖아요, 하지만 저 장군이라는 자는 철갑으로 무장하고 검을 차고 있지 않나요. 한낱 싸움꾼이 어떻게 마법에 능통하다는 거죠?"

에피니아스는 진정으로 분노한듯했지만, 나는 그녀의 심한 무례함과 제멋대로인 추측때문에 웃음이 터졌다. "한낱 싸움꾼이라고 하셨소?" 엄청난 탄식이 들려오는 가운데 내가 말했다. "아가씨, 외면만 보고서 성급하게 판단해서는 안되는것입니다. 만약 내가 외면만 보고 판단한다면 내 앞에 서있는 불과 업화의 주인이자, 그녀의 냉혈한 아버지보다도 더욱 강인한 의지를 가진, 세상의 실을 짜는 사람을 그저 무례한 처녀라고 여겼겠지요. 그렇지만 스스로를 나보다 더 위대한 마법사라고 단정짓진 마시오! 나 아라니온 가야에일은 아케인 블레이드의 통달한 자이며, 강대한 원소의 힘을 불러오는 자입니다. 나의 검을 타고 흐르는 주문은 아가씨의 짧은 인생에서 봤던 모든 오크들보다도 많은 수를 죽였습니다. 아가씨가 평생 볼 오크보다도 많을지도 모르지요."

그녀는 나를 보더니 관심을 보이는듯 했다. "이상한 기술같군요. 누군가가 아득히 멀리 떨어진 적을 간단히 불태울수 있다면 우습게 들릴지도 모르지만, 언젠가 우리가 함께 오크사냥을 한다면 내 기술을 스스로 증명해보겠어요. 그렇지만 당신도 전장에서 날 이기려면 진심으로 임해야할거에요."

"물론 최선을 다하지요, 아가씨"라고 말하며 우스꽝스럽게 머리를 숙이자 리나니일의 입술에 얇은 미소가 스쳐갔다.

투르셀은 앓는 소리를 내며 덥수룩한 머리를 왕에게 돌렸다. "일 얘기로 넘어갑시다" 전해들은것처럼 거칠고 간결한 방식대로 그가 말했다.

에피아네스는 목을 가다듬고 의자에 편안히 앉았다. "우리를 위한 위대한 계획이 있소" 그가 운을 뗐다. "오랜 세월동안 우리는 오크의 습격으로 인해 괴로워했소. 초기에 우리는 매혹의 전투에서 쇠약해졌지만 현재 우리는 다시 힘을 회복하였고 힘을 모아 적을 영원히 잠재울 시간이 왔소. 우리를 모두 지워버리겠다, 문명을 영원히 파괴하겠다는 위협은 너무나도 자주 있었소. 우리 모두 많은 것들을 잃었소. 투르셀이여, 당신의 사람들을 잃은것에 대해서는 깊이 애도를 표하오" 털옷을 입은 사내에게 감정의 변화는 보이지 않았지만 나는 그의 딸들이 침울한 생각에 고개를 떨구는걸 볼수 있었다.

 "이곳에서 동쪽으로 떨어진 쉐르'툴의 원거리 관문에 실험을 위해 우리의 마도사들을 보냈소. 우리는 그곳에서 봉인된 힘을 발동하여 오크 군대에 직접 맞설 수 있는 파괴적인 에너지의 흐름을 만들수 있다고 믿소. 만약 모든 종족들이 오크의 세력을 몰아내는데 협력한다면 이 전쟁을 한번에 끝낼수 있소. 오크들이 회복하는 것보다도 빠르게 학살할수 있소. 그렇게 된다면 에이알에는 오크란 존재가 없는 청정한 지역이 되겠지.

 "다른 종족들의 우두머리와 접선하고있소. 하플링들은 완전히 협조적이고 나르골의 섭정은 쉐르'툴 폐허에 대한 역사적인 연구자료들을 우리에게 제공하기도 하였소"

투르셀이 갑자기 욕설을 퍼부었다. "인간을 노예로 한 실험말인가!" 그가 소리질렀다. 그리고는 흥분이 빠져나가길 기다리는것마냥 조용해졌다. "바다와 숲속의 형제들은 어떤가?"

에피아네스는 냉정하게 그를 바라보았다. "날로레는 자만이 넘쳐 협력하길 꺼렸소. 스스로 자기네땅을 보호할수 있다고 믿는 모양이오. 하지만 종국에는 우리에게 고마워하리라 믿소... 탈로레 역시 원하는 눈치는 아니오. 하지만 그들의 왕과 여왕과 상의한 결과 우리의 작전을 보호하겠다는 확언을 받았소. 그들은 우리나 우리의 장군을 완전히 믿지는 못하지만 우리의 반대입장에 서지는 않을것이오. 샤툴은 우리들중 누구보다도 국경에서 오크와 싸우느라 지친 상태요. 그들이 자신들의 깃발 아래에 모여있는한 우리에게 간편한 원조를 해줄것이오. 물론 그들이 특별히 필요하다고 판단하지는 않지만, 신중을 기하기 위해 가능한 모든 이들을 포함해야한다 생각했소.

 "다른 인간의 지도자들은 대부분 동의했소. 몇몇은 우리의 행동에 완전히 비이성적인 공포를 보이더군. 세상에, 아직도 전설과 신화들이 쉐르'툴에 관한 것이라면 겁부터 집어먹게 만들고 있다니. 하지만 우리가 무얼 하고 있는지 잘 알기에 우리는 자신있소. 분명히 칼'쿠를 정예들은 이해할거요. 그리고 그대와의 동맹은 다른 수십개의 동맹보다도 더 가치있소."

투르셀은 에피아네스의 눈을 뚫어지게 오래 바라보다 딸들에게로 몸을 돌렸다. "어떻게 생각하느냐 딸들아?"

네이라가 목소리에 감정을 담아 먼저 대답하였다. "저는 샬로레 왕이 냉정하며 자부심이 지나치다고 여깁니다. 그가 우리네 어머니의 기억을 도구로 사용하면서 말하는 것이 안쓰럽기까지 합니다. 선언하고자 하는 바는 알겠으나 우리들 중 그 누가 쉐르'툴의 유물에 무엇이 교묘하게 숨겨있을지 안단 말입니까? 천년이 넘는 세월동안 누구도 손 대지 않았고 진정한 힘은 아직도 밝혀지지 않았습니다. 얼마나 오만해야 그 힘을 마음대로 다룰 수 있다고 믿는겁니까? 어떻게 사용할지도 모르는 힘을 무기로 사용하고자 함은 멍청한짓입니다."

방안은 적막으로 가득찼고 나는 에피아네스의 고요한 분노를 보았다. 에피아네스는 이런 공개적인 비난에 익숙하지 않았다. 그때 리나니일이 입을 열었다. 그녀의 목소리는 낮고 차가웠지만 모든 귀는 그녀의 말에 집중하고 있었다. "많은 것들이 거만을 등에 얹고 수년간 매진하여 웅장함을 뽐내지요. 우리의 위대한 마법, 위대한 도시, 우리의 사회를 한데 묶어주는 마법의 실을 짜는 일들이 모두 어디에서 왔습니까? 그것들을 만들때 겸손함은 없었습니다. 자부심을 가지고 실행에 옮기는 일은 부끄러운 일이 아닙니다. 부적절한 겸손에서 얻을 것이란 아무것도 없습니다. 공포와 용기가 없는 베짱때문에 쉐르'툴의 힘은 너무나 오랫동안 방치되어왔습니다" 이때 나는 그녀의 눈빛에서 흥분의 빛을 엿보았다. "우리가 봉인을 해제하여 얻을 영광을 생각해보세요! 오크와의 전쟁은 단지 시작일 뿐입니다. 우리 모두에게 엄청난 이득이 생길것입니다. 그런 힘을 묻힌 채로 내버려 둔다는 것은 죄악이라 말하겠습니다."

투르셀이 고개를 천천히 끄덕이기전에 반사적으로 잠시 멈췄고 리나니일의 생각이 투르셀 자신의 생각보다 더 논리적임이 명백했다. "아주 좋소" 그가 에피아네스를 똑바로 쳐다보며 천천히 대답했다. "함께 하겠소" 네이라는 생각을 곱씹으며 조용하게 있었지만 자매 리나니일의 눈에는 만족의 빛이 스쳐지나갔다.]],

#{bold}#제 2장: 잊을 수 없는 밤#{normal}#

그 날 이후로 삼일 뒤, 어둠속에서 창문이 열린 채 실크 드레스가 바람에 휘날리고 있었고 그로 인해 나는 잠에서 깨고 말았다. 눈이 어둠에 적응이 되었을때 리나니일이 찬 밤공기 속에서 얇은 하늘색의 드레스만을 입은 채 내 침대 발치에 서있는걸 볼 수 있었다. 리나니일을 감싸고 있는 옅은 룬으로 장식된 오팔이 박힌 캐시미어 벨트, 목과 손목을 감싸고 있는 귀금속들이 보였다. 리나니일의 손에는 긴 마법지팡이가 가볍게 들려있었고 지팡이의 윗부분에는 루비가 반짝이고 있었다. 리나니일이 나를 빤히 바라보는 동안 붉은 머리가 바람에 휘날렸다.
 
 "여기서 뭐하시는 겁니까? 내가 물었다. 어떻게 많은 경비병들을 피해서 나의 침실까지 숨어들었는지 묻는 어리석음은 범하지 않았다. 리나니일이 환영마법에 집중한다면 의회에 그 누구라도 그녀의 존재를 눈치채지 못한다는 사실을 알고있었기 때문이다.
 
그녀는 나를 천천히 바라보고는 고개를 돌려 나의 개인적인 공간으로 눈을 돌려 하나하나 분석하는 중이였다. "북쪽에 오크무리가 들끓고 있어요" 산만한 목소리로 리나니일이 말했다. 그녀는 선반에서 장식용 단검을 집어들고 자세히 살펴보면서 말을 이어갔다. "외곽에 살고 있는 엘프들에게 오크가 문젯거리가 되는 모양이에요."
 
 "지금 당장 토벌대를 보내겠소" 예의는 잊은채 침대에서 몸을 재빠르게 일으키며 말했다.
 
 "아, 지루해요!" 리나니일이 단검을 내려놓고 나를 바라보며 불평했다. "같이 오크사냥을 가자는 약속을 잊은건 아니겠죠?"
 
 "뭐라구요? 우리 단 둘이서 말입니까?"
 
 "그럼요" 그녀가 즐거워하는듯한 시선으로 나의 알몸을 위 아래로 천천히 훑어보며 말했다. "사나이도 아니라는 말인가요?"
 
 "엘프에게 그런 질문은 꽤나 이상하군요 아가씨. 하지만 오크무리들은 혼자서도 처리할수 있소, 이건 확실하오. 만약에 나와 같이 가고 싶다면 아가씨의 안전을 보장할수는 없다오."
 
리나니일은 청량하게 울리는 크리스탈처럼 웃었다. "아주 좋아요! 어서 쇠막대기를 챙겨요 누가 최고인지 두고보죠." 나는 웃음으로 대답한후 병기고로 가서 철제정강이받이와 쇠사슬갑옷을 입고 흉갑과 철제 장갑으로 무장했다. 리나니일은 인내심이 바닥나자 퉁명스럽게 혀를 찼다. "꼭 그 깡통옷을 입어야해요?"
 
 "나의 무구라오" 투구를 쓰고 두꺼운 망토를 어깨에 두르면 대답했다.
 
 "골렘같아 보여요" 리나니일은 짜증난 표정으로 투덜거렸다. "다했으면 가요, 지겨워지려고 해요" 리나니일은 창 밖으로 뛰어 우아하게 공기를 가르며 밤하늘로 날아갔다.
 
나는 그때 벽에 걸려있던 나의 대검을 집었다. 칼자루에 커다란 월석이 장식되어있는 단순한 검처럼 생겼지만 그 생김새는 검의 진정한 힘을 표현하지 못한다. 드워프들의 자만심으로 인해 그들의 무기는 전투용이 아닌 장식용에 가깝게 변해갔다. 그러나 이 대검은 드워프 역사 초기에 자만심에 물들지 않은 드워프들이 제련한 검이다. 결코 무뎌지는 법 없이 칼날은 쉽게 갑옷과 뼈를 갈라버린다. 나는 신경 쓰지 않지만 월단검이라고 불리는듯하다. 창문밖으로 뛰어내리기 전 검으로 공기를 가르며 아래에 공기의 층을 만들었다. 그리고는 리나니일을 뒤좇기 시작했다.
 
흩뿌려진 구름사이로 벌어진 조용하지만 긴박한 경주는 리나니일이 내려가기 전까지 20여분이나 게속되었다.  나는 산등성이 사이에 자리 잡은 마을의 불길을 볼 수 있었고 우리가 가까이에 접근하자 오크의 전장 구호가 선명하게 들려왔다. "어떻게 접근해야하지?" 마법사라면 어떤 전략을 선보일지 궁금한 마음으로 물었다.

 "직접적으로요" 그렇게 말함과 동시에 리나니일은 폭발적인 속도로 오크 야영지 위로 나타나 한가운데에 내려앉았다. 오크들이 분노로 소리를 지르며 경보를 울리고 무기를 쥐어들자 나는 망할 속도로 쫓아가 그녀의 옆에 내려앉고는 월단검을 꺼내들었다. 어두운 검, 창, 도끼창이 우리를 둘러쌓기 시작하자 리나니일은 나를 바라보고 말했다. "춤 출 시간이에요."
 
리나니일의 왼손에 들려있는 마법지팡이가 횃불처럼 불타오름과 동시에 그녀의 오른손에서는 보라색의 마법에너지의 광선이 뿜어져나갔다. 내가 검을 높게 치켜듦과 동시에 나의 검에서는 불길이 치솟았고 내 앞으로 커다란 호를 그리며 휘둘렀다. 가장 선두에 있던 오크는 잘려나가고 화염의 충격파가 뒤에 따라오던 부대를 강타했다. 뜨거운 바람을 불러일으키면서 나는 앞으로 나아갔고 내 앞에 서있던 오크들은 물러날 수 밖에 없었다. 오크들은 얼굴을 가리기 위해 무기를 떨어뜨렸고 나는 만족스러운 웃음을 띄면서 머리를 자르기 위해 달려나갔다. 그러나 내가 검을 휘두르는 순간 내 뒤에서부터 화염폭발이 일어나 나는 땅에 처박혔다. 뒤를 돌아보자 리나니일이 불의 기둥속에 서있었고 그녀의 손은 공간을 확장하는듯 뻗어있었다. "너무 뜨거운가요, 아라니온?" 주위의 오크들이 바삭하게 구워지고 검은 먼지로 변하자 리나니일이 소리쳤다.
 
나는 투덜대며 나의 검에 얼음의 힘을 불러왔다. 그리고는 재빠르게 리나니일 주변의 오크들에게 얼어붙을만큼 차가운 급류를 쏟아내자 오크들에게 불이 채 닿기도 전에 유리조각처럼 산산이 부숴져버렸다. 리나니일은 그녀를 둘러싼 화염을 잠재우며 내 이름에 대고 욕을 했다. "내 즐거움을 망치지 말아요!" 그녀는 소리를 지르고 야영지의 반대편으로 순간이동해서는 그곳의 오크들을 터트리기 시작했다.

나는 껄껄 웃으며 가장 가까이에 있는 놈을 바라보았다. 한 번 휘두를 때마다 대지가 격동하여 오크들은 서있기 힘들었고 나의 검은 목을 정확히 찾아냈다. 그리곤 강력한 전격주문을 외워 가장 촘촘히 모여있는 곳을 노려 꿰뚫었고, 오크들은 미처 반응하기도 전에 잘려나갔다. 나는 그 빛줄기를 따라서 돌진했다. 전장의 열기로 나는 다시 한번 웃었고 열등한 적들을 학살하며 전장을 돌아다니는 즐거움을 얻기 위해 투구를 버리고 판갑을 몸에서 잡아 찢어버렸다. 월단검은 오크의 살덩어리속에서 춤을 추었고 오크들의 검은 피는 솟구쳐올라 흥겨운 리듬의 분수가 되었다.

야영지의 반대쪽 방향에서는 폭발과 비명이 리나니일의 행보를 보여주고 있었고 하늘을 날아다니는 불타는 사지들과 밤조차 찢어버리는 불길을 보았다. 리나니일은 불 속에서 반짝이는 눈으로 환하게 미소짓고 있었다.  그녀 주위에 타오르는 불길은 마치 그녀가 인간의 모습을 한 불의 요정같이 보이게 만들었다. 여태까지 봤던 생애 가장 아름다우며 경외심을 갖게하는 장면이였다.

수가 급격하게 감소하자 오크들은 도망치기 시작했다. 하지만 나는 도주로로 근거리 순간이동을 하여 파도를 불러일으켜 오크들을 리나니일의 화염으로 밀어넣었다. 내가 밀어넣은 방향으로 불의 장벽이 솟구쳤고 셀수 없이 많은 오크들이 바람에 흩날리는 낙엽처럼 떨어졌다. 피가 사방으로 튀었다. 오직 몇번의 칼질과 리나니일의 손에서 만들어진 폭발로 전투는 끝이 났다. 단 한마리의 오크도 움직이지 않았고 사백이 넘는 오크 시체만이 바닥에 널부러져있었다.
 
전투가 끝남으로 인해 아드레날린이 빠져나가자 리나니일과 나는 마주보고 급격한 피로를 느끼며 헐떡였다. "세는 걸 까먹었군" 숨을 크게 들이쉬고 이어서 말했다, "누가 더많이 죽였는지…' 리나니일은 얼굴에 땀을 흘리며 부끄러운듯 나를 보며 웃었다. 그녀의 로브는 한쪽 어깨끈이 느슨해진채 자잘한 상처와 불에 탄 흔적으로 걸레가 되어버렸다. 숨을 쉴 때마다 그녀의 아름다운 가슴은 위아래로 들썩였고 그녀의 깊은 눈동자는 나를 강렬하게 바라보았다.
 
그녀가 앞으로 다가와 나의 사슬갑옷을 거칠게 잡고는 나의 입술의 그녀의 입술로 끌어당겼다. 키스는 뜨겁고 강렬했다. 리나니일의 나의 아랫입술을 깨물자 전장에서의 혈기가 다시 살아났다. 나는 한번 더 키스하면서 리나니일의 몸을 가깝게 끌어당겼고 입술은 떨어질줄 몰랐다. 리나니일은 음탕하게 나머지 갑옷마저 벗겨서 바닥에 내던졌고 나는 그녀의 옷을 벗겼다. 별들 아래 우리는 알몸으로 서있었다. 그리고는 여전히 전투의 헐떡임과 땀이 남아있는채로 서로를 밀어붙였다. 불타는 열정으로 살과 살이 만나 차가운 밤하늘에 뜨거운 신음소리가 울려퍼졌다.]],

“Why are ye not leader?” asked Linaniil, resting her head in her hand with her naked form strewn across my bed.
 
I looked at her, surprised by the sudden question.  My mind struggled briefly with the strange query, still recovering from the heat of sex but a minute before.  “Why should I be leader?” I asked back.
 
“Because ye are strong, of course,” she responded.  “I deem ye stronger in battle than any of your kin.  Ye should rule with such strength.”
 
I chuckled softly.  “Mere strength is not enough to rule a people.  It requires responsibilities, careful decision making, and above all – politics.  I have no interest in such matters.  Ephinias is far better suited to those sorts of things.  Give me a sword and soldiers to lead into battle and I am content.  Let the leaders worry about where I should point my blade.”

She was quiet a moment, seemingly dissatisfied with that response.  “Ye are not happy with the current plans though.”

For a moment I was struck with shock.  It surprised me how clearly she divined my inner thoughts.  I had not expressed my concerns to anyone, yet she could so easily read me.  Five weeks it had been since we first met, and it seemed like there was nothing I could hide from her keen sight.
 
The preparations for the Spellblaze were well underway.  Turthel of the Kar’Krul had returned to his northern citadel, but he left his daughters as ambassadors to aid in our designs.  It meant Linaniil and I had many an opportunity to meet, though we kept it secret.  Few of my race would understand or approve of such a liaison, and none of us could afford a scandal. Yet I could not resist this human mage’s advancements, nor she mine.
 
“I am a warrior,” I said to her finally, getting brusquely from my bed and recovering my robes.  “I settle my battles facing my foe, not by toying with relics from afar.  It irks me that we must deal with our enemies in such a craven way.”

“But does it not excite ye, using these Sher’Tul ruins?” she said, putting a finger to her lower lip as she still languished in my bed, the sheets sticking tightly to her bare skin.  She seemed visibly aroused by her thoughts.  “Such powers lain dormant for so long, ready to be summoned to our control...  How it were I to command so great a venture!”

I shook my head sadly as I finished buttoning up my doublet.  “I do not trust those ruins.  We Shaloren are mighty, but we have yet to reach the heights of the Sher’Tul, nor do we truly understand the devices they have left behind.  My thoughts are more with your sister Neira on this.  We should stick to what abilities we have mastered, without stretching ourselves to such grand experimentation.”
 
Linaniil looked at me intently, a touch of humour in her dark eyes.  “If ye were leader then ye could stop this.  But then I would have to hate ye.”
 
I allowed myself a thin smile.  “Well, that would indeed be a terrible and dangerous thing.”  I finished dressing whilst Linaniil still lay in my bed, her face reflective.  “I must go now to check on the latest operations at the farportal.  You are welcome to join me.”
 
She shook her head languidly.  “Nay, I wish to rest more.  And besides, hearing their reports would but make me jealous.  Leave me here awhile – I wilst depart in secret later.”
 
I left my chamber then, dark thoughts now brooding at the back of my mind.  The date was coming closer when our plans would come to fruition and the Great Spellblaze would be unleashed.  A heavy foreboding lay over my heart.  Yet the alternatives seemed grim.  The war with the orcs was going badly, with few races able to secure their borders well and attacks from the brutes ever increasing.  Their numbers seemed inexhaustible.  Though they had little skill in warfare they could bring great harm to unprotected townsteads, and in enough force could bring down cities.  One human kingdom had collapsed under their attacks but a week before.  After that many who had initially rejected our plans came begging for our protection.  The Spellblaze seemed our only hope against imminent disaster.
 
Such thoughts were weighing on my mind as I passed from my chambers in the palace, down to the courtyard by the main gate.  Then from the corner of my eye I saw a swish of long red hair, and spun round thinking Linaniil had followed me.  But the golden robes and bright eyes of Neira revealed otherwise.
 
“Expecting someone else?” she asked with a wide smile, seeing the surprised look on my face.
 
“I was deep in thought,” I explained, bowing slightly to greet her.  “I am just on my way to inspect the farportal operations.  Perhaps you-“
 
“I shall join ye,” she said quickly, not waiting for my invitation.  I nodded my assent and guided her to my carriage.
 
As soon as we took off east the mood changed.  “She wilst only hurt ye,” said Neira suddenly.
 
I cursed quietly, understanding her meaning.  “Are there no secrets to be had in all Eyal?” I muttered.
 
“Not between sisters, and especially not between twins.”  She smiled warmly at me, yet there was no humour in her eyes.  “I mean it though.  I love mine sister, but I know her ways.  She be fickle, and willed to do her own thing when she likes.  Do not be surprised when she bores of ye.  Nor hurt.”
 
“I am quite capable of taking care of myself,” I said in clipped tone.
 
She gazed into my eyes a moment and then turned away to stare out the window.  “Well, I have warned ye...” she replied softly, a touch of sadness in her voice.
 
Was it jealousy perhaps that stirred such an outburst?  And for her sister’s attention or for mine?  I never did discover.  The rest of the trip was spent in sullen silence.  The sun was setting behind our carriage, casting a long shadow on the path ahead, and bathing the land about in crimson light.  It seemed for a moment like we rode into some demon’s plane, pitch black shadows melting into blood-red soil, whilst cold white stars began to spear through the sky above.  I shivered suddenly as the ruins came into view.
 
Few Sher’Tul ruins have been discovered which even come close to matching the grandeur of those which were near Elvala.  Many centuries our people spent excavating them, digging deep into the ground, ever careful not to damage or upset the relics.  The centrepiece was the Crystal Tower.  From the surface all that could be seen of it was a wide, even-sided square, which when cleaned of soil revealed a white stone smoother than marble.  But delving down our archaeologists found it plummeted deep, deep below the ground.  Half a mile it went down, the featureless white stone not bearing a single mark or engraving anywhere on its surface, until it ended suddenly and without foundation.  It was like the whole tower was separate from the earth, some strange thing of the stars that had dropped from the skies and lay sleeping beneath the soil.
 
Some years earlier our people had solved the invisible runes that allowed it to be opened, revealing vast crystal-lined halls and chambers arrayed in geometric patterns of sublime beauty.  Light sparked and shone from every surface, and the walls seemed to hum with energy.  Many shafts and passageways could only be navigated by flight, and at the top was found a grand room large enough to encompass the whole palace of Elvala.  At its centre was the farportal, a raised dais forty feet in diameter and crackling with energy upon which slowly spun a cloud of stars.  It was beautiful and frightening, enchanting and terrifying.  No power of the Shaloren could discern its operation, and though through careful experimentation we were able to manipulate its energies, never could we get a true grasp of the forces that lay beneath.

Neira and I descended to the base of the tower, smothered in the cold shadows of the excavated ruins.  I nodded to the guards as we passed through the square white entrance, and Neira’s eyes instantly enlarged in wonder.  The scintillating rooms were eye-catching to be sure, but they were also desolate and empty.  I tried to imagine what it must have looked like when filled with Sher’Tul.  “How did they all die?” I asked under my breath as we traversed the crystal halls, a question many had asked before.
 
The sorceress picked up on my words and laughed softly.  “It be a mystery, of course!  Mine mother once taught me that they killed themselves in a great civil war, using magics far beyond our imaginings.”
 
“I wonder,” said I.  We had our own records, of course, which we didn’t share with the younger races, but they were not so clear-cut as the many myths that had spread over the ages.
 
We reached the central shaft, and from there levitated up past floors and floors of abandoned chambers, living spaces, workshops, storerooms, and many other areas of purpose undivined by our loremasters.  Finally, after ascending for several minutes, we rose into the grand chamber of the farportal, and Neira gasped to see its size.  Her eyes soon settled on the great Sher’Tul farportal, sparks from it reflecting off the roof hundreds of feet above.  About it were bustling many of our Shaloren mages in silken robes, and Ephinias himself was leading the operations.
 
He broke from his advisers as he saw us arrive, and strode towards us with a confident smile on his face.  Though he wore the grey robes of a research mage he still bore his great golden staff, Luminis, token of his position as king.
 
“Ah, General Aranion!” he said, “You have come at last.  And brought the Kar’Krul girl with you; how splendid.”
 
I gave a small bow.  “Your majesty.  I am here for the update on our operations.”
 
“Yes, yes, of course,” he said with a dismissive hand gesture.  “And doubtless the girl is here to make sure we know what we’re doing?”
 
If Neira was offended she covered it up well.  “It would be mine delight to see evidence of ye skill and power over the ruins, lord Ephinias.”
 
The king smiled and nodded then, and called to some of his aides.  “Prepare the topography demonstration, using the acute fire strand.”  He turned back to us then.  “It is not mere skill and power of course that we can show you, but subtlety and scale too.  Now excuse me a moment whilst I join the others.”
 
He went with two of the senior research mages then to the front of the farportal.  They faced each other and began a low humming in unison, and slowly it seemed that the sparks from the farportal began to flicker redly.  Over the course of a few minutes their hum became a higher pitched chant, but softly sung and still in perfect unison.  As they raised their staffs there appeared above the farportal an image in flames, and looking at it both Neira and I marvelled, for we could see clearly that it was an image of ourselves, looking upwards, as if looking we were staring into a mirror.  Our features and movements were all clearly discernible, down the smallest detail, all carved out of flickering orange fire.
 
Then the chanting rose higher and it seemed the image zoomed out, so that we saw the farportal nearby us and the mages gathered about.  And still the focus soared upwards till we were but specks in a wide hall, until the image was displaced by a white square with carven edges dug into the earth about it, and I knew we were looking at the top of the Crystal Tower from above.  The view widened, and I could see the land rushing away, and the city of Elvala to the west.  The chanting rose higher and now the sea could be seen, and the mountains to the north-west, and all the land about.  And soon the continent was visible, right to the frozen north, and the ocean wrapped all about, and it seemed small white stars were dotted about the landscape.  The singing reached a crescendo and before us hung an image of the whole of Eyal, a globe of fire suspended in mid-air, slowly turning.
 
Then the chanting stopped and the image disappeared, and I could hear beside me Neira suddenly gasp for air, as if she had not dared draw breath through the last few minutes.
 
“You see now?” said Ephinias, grinning with pleasure.  “From the smallest detail to the grandest scale we can manipulate the farportal’s energy.  And did you see those white points marked across the image?  They are the other farportals spread across the world, and this one can connect to them all.  With careful, delicate control we can harmonise the energy of them all and use it to our will.  I’m afraid your sword can be no match to this, Aranion.”
 
I had no words to respond, and only nodded softly, still in awe of what I had seen.  Neira seemed the same, and I could see her now staring at the farportal with the same eager eyes as her sister.  She was converted.
 
Yet my hand strayed across the hilt of Mooncutter, and my heart still murmured with unease.]],

#{bold}#Chapter Four: Before the Dawn#{normal}#

I rode my great grey horse at a low trot, surrounded by my lieutenants and their elite cavalry and spellrangers.  Beside me on a brown mare my squire held high a banner emblazoned with a flame-wreathed sword, symbol of my personal entourage.  The pole seemed to shiver slightly in the young elf’s hands, a sign of nervousness.
 
“Hold that banner firm, boy,” I said in a commanding tone.
 
The squire suddenly sat upright in his saddle, and gripped tight on the banner pole.  “Yes, sire!” he said, alarmed.  “Whatever you say, sire!”  He kept his head faced forward but I could see his eyes glance towards me, desperate for approval.  Whatever I say indeed...  I had seen his gaze on me before, with all the adoration of a young soldier towards his commander, and perhaps a little more.  If I had not the joy of Linaniil’s company then the attention of such a pretty lad would not be unwelcome.  But this was not the time for such thoughts.
 
This would be the day, the day of the Spellblaze, and the boy had every right to be nervous.  It was a few hours after midnight, and already our scouts would be engaged alongside the other races, drawing out the orcs from their hiding places.  We marched through our main offensive lines, where we would hem them in before the great conflagration.  All around were arrayed spears and swords and mail, glistening in the starlight.  Troops upon troops of battlemages in purple robes held aloft glowing staves.  It was a sight to behold.  Yet we knew also the risk of engaging on open ground with the orcs in their full numbers.  If the Spellblaze failed then we would suffer greatly.

I set up camp upon a low hill overlooking the field, and then left my entourage to seek the Kar’Krul army to the north.  As I rode my stallion towards their station I could see smoke rising in the east.  Four thick grey plumes stood out against the pre-dawn light.  They would be villages looted and burned by the orcs as they rampaged against our feigned assaults.  The townsteads would be empty, but after this battle there would be nothing left for their residents to return to.  A small sacrifice in a game of war that spanned the continent.

A fifth column of smoke began to rise, and in the greenish haze of early morn those pillars of smoke suddenly seemed to look like a demonic hand stretching over the world, ready to dig its claws into the earth and rip out the flesh beneath.  This, I knew, was the threat the orcs faced to us all, a menace to all civilisation.  Whatever price we paid to stop them would be a small one.  So I thought.  So we all thought.
 
When I reached the Kar’Krul camp Linaniil came out to meet me.  Her smile was warm at the sight of me, but I could tell from her eyes that she was more excited for the events of the day.  “Just a few more hours,” she whispered like an impatient child.  “This will be fascinating!”
 
As I came in the Kar’Krul pavilion I saw Neira inside, and some of their senior mages and delegates from other human kingdoms.  I knew Turthel would not be with them, as he stayed in his northern city with his people.  It was not cowardice nor age that held him back from the front lines of war.  Indeed, it was said that ever since his wife was killed by the orcs he had to restrain himself from battle, lest his anger overcome him and he destroy friend and foe alike in his rage.  Yet it was known that sometimes he would venture through the lands alone, and he would bring with him a deafening storm of wrath, and the orcs would cower at the rumour of the approach of Turthel, Tempest of the North.
 
Neira and Linaniil commanded the Kar’Krul forces, and from the firm-set look on their archmages’ faces it was clear that they were ready for whatever the day would bring.  Yet Neira looked troubled, doubt evident in her eyes.
 
“What irks your sister?” I whispered to Linaniil.
 
“Some dumb dream,” she responded callously.
 
Neira’s eyes shot up.  “It were not a dream!” she barked.  “An omen it were, I tell ye!”  She turned to me then with pleading eyes.  “Ye must believe me, Aranion.  Something wilst go terribly wrong today.  I saw last night a terrible sight in mine dreams, as if it were a memory of long ago.  There were a burning city, made of glass and silver and marble.  And as it burned I did hear the cries of thousands, tens of thousands, young and old all dying.  And then the city fell, for it had been held in the sky, and it crashed down to the earth with a shattering torment that spilled across the land.  And other cities there were, and pillars of violet light struck up from them, and they did dance around filling the air with the scent of ozone and seared flesh.  Death was everywhere!  Death like none we have ever seen.
 
“It were no mere dream I tell ye.  It be a message, a warning - some forgotten tale of the dangers we play with.  We must stop this thing!”
 
Linaniil was tapping her foot impatiently as her sister raved, but I could see some of the other leaders looking worried.  I knew I had to quiet Neira down, so I drew myself near and put my hands on her shoulders, looking her calmly in the eyes and bringing my face close.
 
“It may well be that this is no dream.  For this is no normal day, and even in all the legends of ages past this will stand out as a day of reckoning.  Our civilisation in under peril, our way of life threatened from the orcish scourge.  We rest upon a knife edge, the world balancing on a pivot, and the wrong sway could tip us into darkness and despair forever.  Our actions today will decide this.  So yes, you have had a warning, you have had a message, and that message is to be strong.  For today we all hold the reins of fate in our palms, and only the steady hand can guide us past the threat of doom that is to come.  Neira, can you be that steady hand?”
 
She looked at me with open and hopeful gaze, her fingers clenched around my wrist as if she sought to draw strength from me.  She nodded slowly then.  “I’m sorry Aranion.  I just... I’ll be strong.”
 
I turned to the others who all seemed rapt by my words.  It was clear that leaving them to their own thoughts could only bring trouble.  I had to pull them into action straight away.  “It begins now!” I shouted.  “Gather your troops and prepare for the march.  Slow and steady we shall advance, carefully shall we hold the battle, and beyond fire and fury we will emerge free and victorious.  This day shall stand in history forever!  This day shall mark a new era for all the races!  The day of the Spellblaze is here!”

They all cheered and rushed to order their troops, taking courage from the duties of command.  Neira went to her own mages, and I left the pavilion alone.  But outside I was ambushed by Linaniil, who pulled me into an empty tent with a playful laugh.
 
“Ye said ye were no leader!” she exclaimed with a grin.  “That were a leader’s speech if ever I heard one.”

I shrugged and smiled modestly.  “I said what I had to.”
 
She drew close then, a sudden flush of worry in her face.  “It were just a dream, right?”  I could see then beneath all the bravado and humour she was mortally scared, her fingers trembling as she gazed into my eyes, yearning for reassurance.
 
“It was just a dream,” I lied, and it is a lie I have paid for with all my heart and soul.  “Everything will be all right.”  I pulled her close and wrapped my arms around her slender frame, and she held tight to me, still trembling slightly.
 
“Thank you, Aranion,” she whispered.  Turning up her face she kissed me, and it was the softest, most delicate kiss she ever gave me.  It was also the last.
 
We parted then, and I began the lonely ride back to my own troops.  My heart was now pounding like a deafening war drum, whilst the words of Neira still echoed round my head.  They stirred up a memory in me of a dream I myself had that morning, but that had laid dormant in my mind till then.  I was lying in my bed, and floating above me was a shape of light and air, like the figure of a creature I had never seen before.  It had long tentacles for arms, and billowing robes fluttered about it slowly.  Where it should have a head there was only a small bump, but I could tell it was focused on me.  It stretched out a long tentacle towards me, as if it were warding against a dark and dangerous threat.  A feeling came over me of terrible foreboding, the looming portent of a doom like no other the world had ever seen.  As the tip of the tentacle neared my brow everything went black.

Was it a dream?  Some strange foretelling?  Or could it have been a true apparition, something trying to give me a direct warning?  But I had no time for such thoughts.  The time of the Spellblaze was nearly upon us, and there could be no room for doubt.  I spurred my horse on to my fate.]],

#{bold}#Chapter Five: The Day of the Spellblaze#{normal}#

I loosened Mooncutter in its sheath as the troops marched forwards.  My grip tightened on the reins, holding my horse in check lest it gallop ahead in the excitement, and I could see my squire to my left doing the same.  The tension in the air was palpable.  Before us, less than a mile away, the vanguard of the orcish armies was now visible.  We had stirred up their nest and they had responded in full force.  They were like a shadowy blight that swallowed up the horizon, a great pestilence that threatened to consume the world.  Before me the armies of the Shaloren seemed small in comparison, but I knew our strength was not told by mere numbers.

Trumpets blared from the bulwarks at the front, as they readied to engage with the first wave when needed.  To the north were archers to crumble the initial resistance, and at their flank a legion of spellriders, their hands glowing with arcane energies as they sat atop their fearsome steeds.  On the south was the regular cavalry, the greatswords, the armoured knights and the main bulk of our mages, readying support spells.  Here and there senior battlemages were dotted about, ready to move swiftly to points of intense activity and blast it away.  There was no need to have more than one of them in any place - alone they could decimate a score of orcs with ease.

Drums beat loudly in the distance, and a clamour arose from the enemy.  They had with them trained beasts and trolls, and were arrayed in swords and maces and crude armours.  One took up a loud howl and others joined in, and the air seemed to reverberate with their ugly voices.

The cacophony was unsettling, but my army responded with a display of power.  Swords and speartips rose into the air, and crackles of lightning shot up to the heavens, the sparks shining off the gleaming blades and armour.  The orcish army gasped in dismay.  The eastern skyline was beginning to glow red, and we knew the dawn would break any moment now, the signal for the start of the Great Spellblaze.

“The day is here!” one of our warriors shouted out, and it was taken up elsewhere by the marching troops.  “The day is here!” they began to chant, anticipating the glory to come.  “The day is here!” my squire sang, his voice full of youthful joy and hope.  “The day is here!” we all shouted in unison, the pride of the Shaloren kingdom in our hearts as we watched the first rays of sunlight shine out from the horizon.  “The day is here!  The day is here!  The day is-”

Silence.  All at once our voices dropped, and a terrible brooding silence swept over the battlefield.  We could feel it, every one of us, so attuned are our race to the flows of magic.  It was like having the breath sucked from one’s lungs, or the earth disappear from beneath one’s feet.  All our mana channels were gone, changed suddenly, arcane energies beyond all reach.  Groans and murmurs began to arise, as mages clutched at their heads in sudden despair.  I saw my squire lurch forwards in his saddle and begin to vomit uncontrollably, my standard slipping from his hand, whilst others fell to the ground in pain.  I struggled to battle an overwhelming migraine, blotches appearing in front of my eyes, and with great effort of will I managed to keep control of myself and began to seek out new paths of mana.

But there was something wrong, terribly wrong.  Like a river run off its course the flow of magic across the whole of Eyal had changed.  What could have caused this?  And now I had to fight years of attunement and training that had taught me to naturally rely on the known flows and courses so that I might find new paths, new sources.  And as I did so I put my powers into divination, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

The orcs saw us in disarray and began to charge.  But my attention was turned west, not east, towards Elvala and the Crystal Tower where our leaders had been manipulating the Sher’Tul farportal.  But the tower, I felt, was gone - crumpled into the earth, and from there now emanated a wave of white-hot flame.  The orcs tore into our army with little resistance, their weapons tearing through the elven troops, but they were soon met by a wave of destructive energy far greater.

“Shields!” I shouted out as the whole sky turned redder than blood, but above the sudden deafening roar of roasting air I was not heard.  It would have helped little anyway, defenceless as my army was without their usual sources of mana.  Spears of flame streaked down on our heads, shearing through flesh and steel in an instant and sinking into the earth.  The ground shook, and lava blasted up from the deep holes torn into the rock.

I put an arcane shield about myself with a great effort of will.  I saw my squire raise a hand to do the same, but a blaze tore off his arm.  He didn’t even get to scream before another wave burned through the top half of his torso.  Spurting blood evaporated instantly, and the air became full of red mist and fire.  I leapt from my horse as it neighed and stumbled and fell burning into ash.

Another wave came, and I tried to strengthen my shield, but the force of it took me off my feet and sent me flying.  I was thrashed through the air like a swirling leaf, unable to do anything more than struggle to maintain my protection.  All about my army was being utterly decimated, ranks and ranks of soldiers and mages burnt to a crisp or torn apart by the raw energies.  The orcs were the same, and a huge rent in the ground swallowed great numbers of their troops.  Blasts of lava soon thundered upward and rained down for miles around, turning into glowing rivers of death that swept across the consumed landscape.

How I managed to stay alive I am still not sure.  I almost slipped from consciousness at several points, but by a mental tenacity I never knew I had I managed to stay focused and keep my protective shield active.  I became less aware of my surroundings, not knowing if the bubble of my ward was floating through air or fire or blood, or swallowed into the depths of Eyal into some hell never before witnessed.  At last, after what seemed like a tortuous age, the wave of energy passed, and I found myself lying alone on an outcrop of cracked and parched earth, the air a haze of heat about me.

I struggled to my feet and looked around, seeing nothing but desolation in all directions.  Steam and smoke rose from rents in the ground, and blood, limbs and ashes were strewn about all over.  Nothing was alive.  In a daze I despaired that I was alone of the hundreds of thousands who had stood here but a short while before.  Friends and comrades, mentors and students, people I had never known and ones I was dearly close to - all gone.  A sudden pain lanced my heart as I thought of Linaniil.  She could not be dead, surely?

I gritted my teeth and summoned the energy to levitate, and as I rose I began to get my bearings around the changed landscape.  Slowly I pushed north-east, passing over devastation beyond belief.  I struggled to keep a grip on my sanity as the scent of burnt flesh and blood surrounded me, my vision filled with a horrored landscape beyond imagination, the utter silence more deafening than any sound I had ever heard.  Eventually I came near to where the Kar’Krul army had stood, and cast about the ruined land for some sign of life.  Then faintly I detected something, some small sliver of life, and searching it out I found her.

Her clothes had been mostly burned off, her hair half turned to ash, and blood was seeping freely from burns all across her body.  A weak shield still hummed over her, but as I knelt down and laid a hand on her it vanished.  Quietly she gasped a breath before whispering, “Neira”, and sinking into unconsciousness.  She was still alive, but barely.  I looked about and saw no signs of her sister, or of any of the rest of her troops, other than the scorched flesh and blackened bones that marked the scourging path swept by the blaze.

I began to cast what healing spells I could on Linaniil, but I could tell it was not enough, and my weakened powers could not hope to save her.  I began to cry openly, thinking of all I had lost this day, all that had gone so terribly wrong.  Hope had turned to crisis, and the cruelty of fate was far too much for me to bear.  Cradling my dying love’s head in my lap I turned my face to the sky and screamed.  Torment was in my cracked voice, and I raged against all the injustice of life and the futility of war, surrounded on all sides by blood and bones and ashes.  They had once been souls and lives with hopes and dreams, now all cast away like dust in the wind, and I lamented their deaths and my despair.

But mine was just one voice, one torment, a single note in the great cacophony that spread across the continent.  Millions of lives lost and shattered, millions of voices raised in anguish and torture and suffering, as the devastation continued over all Maj’Eyal from the ultimate force of destruction, the Spellblaze.]],

#{bold}#Chapter Six: A Changed Eyal#{normal}#

Perhaps what happened will never be truly understood.  What Sher’Tul ruins survived the Spellblaze have been little touched since - the burned hand learns its lesson.  But we know that Ephinias and his mages lost control somehow, whatever delicacy and balance they wrought with coming untangled.  At the moment they tried to connect to the other farportals the imbalance was reverberated, resonated, magnified beyond control.  The farportal in the Crystal Tower imploded in a fraction of a second, killing all within and crushing the land about.  The energies in the Sher’Tul relics then erupted in a blaze of white light, turning the air to fire and the ground to ruin.  The blaze swept eastwards, rolling over our battle with an unstoppable destructive force, and then carrying on towards the Thaloren lands.  Most of the ancient forests of Shatur were ripped from their roots, and the lands lain cursed ever since.

Meanwhile the other farportals all over Maj’Eyal erupted, white stone cracking and vast swathes of energy spilling forth.  All of the Cornac lands to the west were turned to desert, the dwarven halls of Korhek crumpled, the midvale plains were risen up as mountains and Lake Nur formed in their wake.  In the south the ancient tower of Darafel was collapsed, and the forests beside it morphed into an ever-broiling scar of lava and blackened earth.  Far in the east the Naloren farportal, the largest of all in Maj’Eyal, disappeared in a vast earthquake that swallowed everything for miles around, and boiling water spewed up to fill its cavernous depths.

And whilst this destruction was wrought the incredible energies disrupted all of the mana flow around Eyal.  Streams of energy that followed set, slowly changing courses, now were flooded and droughted, warped and split.  The threads of the elements were in vast disarray, and any attuned to magic suddenly found themselves far away from their accustomed power sources.

Even the Heavens were changed.  The wandering star of Vor disappeared, the constellations were tilted off their normal course, and the seasons rent harsher since.  Some say the moons dimmed and the sun went whiter after that day.  I do not know.  The whole world has seemed darker to me.

The numbers killed are beyond count.  The initial destruction took at least five million lives, and the terror that followed claimed far more.  For though it had been a day of tragedy and immeasurable woe, it was to be followed by a bloody age of darkness and torment.

But none of this I knew as I lay weeping in the aftermath, cradling in my lap the one life I cared about.  In abject misery I called on all the healing powers I could to bring her back to me for but one moment.  Her heart beat softly, and her eyes opened, but seemed glassy and far away.

“Linaniil,” I whispered, and her dark eyes turned towards my face.  I tried to mumble an apology, to say I was sorry and was unable to help her, but emotions overcame my voice.  Her gaze at me was empty, as if she looked right through me, before she turned her eyes away.  Slowly she raised a hand to an amulet about her neck, and with a light touch it glowed and then cracked.  Her eyes closed again but I could feel the power from the artifact pumping into her, strengthening her heart-beat and mending her flesh.  She was unconscious and still badly wounded, but for now the mortal threat was gone.

My thoughts were mixed - glad she was no longer at death’s door, but worried she might relapse, and at the back of my mind scared of that empty look she had given me.  Could she possibly forgive my part in this?

Carefully I picked up her frail body, and began the journey back to Elvala.  Two days it took on foot, through blasted and ruined ground.  On the passage I came across other survivors, refugees now leaving their destroyed homes, heading to the city to seek shelter.  I tried to nurse Linaniil as best I could, giving her water during brief periods of waking and dressing her wounds, but true healing could not happen till I reached the city.

Elvala was a quiet chaos, oppressed by fear and uncertainty, an air of dread filling all the streets.  The news had broken that our army had been entirely wiped out - there would be no loved ones returning to their families, and the sound of stifled mourning was to be heard in all corners of the city.

I took Linaniil straight to the healing grounds in the palace and gave her to the doctors with the strictest instructions.  They were swamped by casualties, but followed my orders without question, tending immediately to her wounds and applying tinctures and regenerative spells.

It was as I watched over her quietly that a party bustled loudly into the grounds.  I recognised at their head was Perissa, a senior court official.  At her side was an elderly human who immediately went to where Linaniil lay.

“General Aranion!” announced Perissa loudly, “I heard you were here, but I could scarce believe it.  Thank the threads you have returned to us!  This is a grave time; we must talk at once.”

But I ignored her as I saw the human touch Linaniil’s hand, and her eyes gently open.  “Cuilan?” she murmured softly.

“Aye, it is me, my lady,” he said quietly.  “I have been sent here by your father.  He has ordered me to pass you this.”  And with that he brought forth a golden ring set with a fiery ruby.  I recognised it immediately as the Ring of Kar’Krul, worn by the mighty Turthel.  Linaniil sat up quickly, wincing from the pain, but with her eyes locked on the ring as it was placed in her hand.

“But mine father...”

“I’m sorry, my lady.  It brings me great sorrow to bear you this news.  Your father and his court are dead.  His last act was to instruct me to bring this ring to you and your sister.  Neira...” he said glancing about.  “Is she...?”  He saw the look in Linaniil’s eyes and dipped his head despondently.  “I see.  I am terribly sorry.  It becomes my duty then, my lady, to declare you the new leader of the Kar’Krul.”

“General Aranion,” interjected Perissa.  “I really must speak with you now!”

“Wait!” I barked, and turned to the human Cuilan.  “What is happening here?  How could one such as Turthel be killed?”

The man looked at me then with a wan sadness in his eyes, before turning to address Linaniil.  “Yesterday, the day after the terrible Spellblaze, as we began some attempt at reconstruction, still struggling to realign our mana paths, a murmur began amongst the people.  It spoke thus: The Kar’Krul circle of mages had betrayed the ordinary people.  They accused us of siding with the elves to destroy non-mages, of toying with terrible powers beyond our control, of deliberately massacring them out of evil and malice.  We could not logic with them, they would listen to no reason, and they rose up in violent anger.  They attacked many of us, with farming instruments and whatever weapons they could find.  Our defences were weak, and striking back just made the crowd fiercer.  We retreated to your father’s home, begging for help, but he shook his head and said he could not fight back.  They came for us then, storming his palace, and Turthel ordered all to put up no resistance.  He handed me his ring, saying to seek you out in Elvala, and then stepped outside to face the crowds.  He didn’t resist!  The people... they... they...”  He lapsed into sullen silence, shaking his head in sorrow.  He looked like he wanted to cry, but had no tears left to shed.  Linaniil’s face was graven and she stared hard at the ring.

Perissa grabbed me then and turned me to her attention.  “This is what I need to speak with you about, General Aranion.  If this human’s tale is to be believed then we are in very grave danger!  Scout reports suggest there is a body of humans coming here from the north as we speak.  From what this human says they seek retribution - they wish to slaughter us all.  A storm of wrath lies on our borders and we are defenseless!  We need you desperately to organise our defence, to protect our city and our people.”

I felt numb, the events overwhelming me.  “But who leads us?” I said.

“There is no one.  What royals are known to be alive are not suited.  We are entering a time of war, a terrible time like no other we have ever faced.  We need military leadership.  You, General Aranion, you must be our leader.”

I held Perissa’s gaze then and saw the wisdom in her words.  My duty as a Shaloren was clear.  But my heart tremored as I turned to look at Linaniil.

“This be our path then, Aranion,” she said quietly, raising herself from the bed and carefully placing the ring on the middle finger of her right hand.  “I must tend to mine people, and ye to yours.  We will not meet again.”

“But your wounds-” I tried to object.

“Will never heal!” she cried, hate dripping from her voice.  Her eyes were like cold and impenetrable ice, a smouldering anger deep within.  “Come, Cuilan, we must leave this place.”  And with that they departed, Linaniil walking tall and proud in spite of her injuries.

I closed off my heart and my emotions then, lest they overwhelm me.  My duty was before me, and the events of the past had to be locked away from memory.

The ceremony was organised in under an hour, and I was anointed leader of the Grand Council of Elvala, head of the Shaloren people.  On my order rangers began transporting in survivors from outpost settlements, whilst I commanded our remaining mages to begin a new endeavour around our city walls.

The first waves of the storm of hate came the next day.  Human peasants and farmers, ordinary workers armed poorly, their looted swords and spears badly wielded.  I stood alone at our gates as they approached, Mooncutter in my hand.  When the first few charged at me I thrust the blade into the soil and tore a great chasm in the earth, and our mages summoned forth mists and smoke that rose from the ground and began to surround our whole city.  As the peasants stumbled in confusion archers started firing from our walls.  What few made it through the smoke and arrows I took on, tearing Mooncutter through their flesh with little resistance.  Their blood gushed out in the gallons, drenching our ground, staining my skin.  It was like a warm shower over my boiling emotions, a bath of blood to wash over my sins.

The Shroud of Elvala was begun, as our whole city was wreathed in cloud and smoke.  Our shield, our mask, our hiding.  It would last for centuries, the only dealings with the outside world being in furtive secrecy.

We veiled our guilt, cloaked our crimes.  Though we had some communication with the outside through halfling traders and the odd disguised Shaloren adventurer, we remained mute to the world at large, hidden from their accusing gaze.  Outside our quiet walls others had not the luxury of hiding.  The Spellhunt was begun, and it knew no mercy.

Ordinary people rose up against what they perceived as the arrogance of the mages, a revolt against the power of the few that had ruined the lives of so many.  Any suspected of sorcery or ties to the Art were cruelly dealt with.  There was sympathy for none, and many innocents fell victim to the unquenchable thirst for retribution.  The madness swept across the whole of Maj’Eyal.

Law and order had broken down.  Armies, territories and whole cities had been destroyed or ravaged by the Spellblaze, with many areas left completely uninhabitable.  Kingdoms fell and tyrants arose.  Bandits picked at the bones of civilisation like vultures on a rotten corpse.

An organisation called the Ziguranth, thought dead long ago, came into resurgence, gaining popular support from the people in their anti-magic crusade.  We heard of some mages going into hiding, but inevitably being rooted out, or fleeing desperately from place to place.  Dark tales also arose of necromancers and fell wizards creating dungeons and strongholds, fending off or evading attacks, and beginning reigns of terror.

And one tale came to my ears of a group of mages that managed to band together and stay in hiding, though always on the run from the chasing Ziguranth.  The story from outside was that they were led by a demon with fiery hair, fiercely glowing eyes and hands wrapped in flames, that fought with blazing wrath and could be opposed by none.  I knew that description well...

I carried out my reign, my duty, taking care of the Shaloren people.  We were safe from attackers, secure in our supplies through discrete trade, and slowly building back some of what we had lost.  But both fear and shame prevented us from showing our face to the world.

Fifteen long years passed before I awoke one night in my council chambers, the crescent Wintertide moon softly illuminating a shape near the end of my bed.  The figure was tall and slim, wrapped in tight-fitting wools and furs.  Her crimson hair stirred gently as she stood with her back to me.  Memories arose of a night long ago, in a more innocent time, when a younger me and a younger her first became close.

I barely dared to whisper her name, afraid that she might disappear, an apparition or a dream that could be broken by a spoken word.  “Linaniil,” I softly mouthed.  She turned to me, and I saw those same dark eyes I remembered.  But they were surrounded by lines of care, the markings of years of strain and responsibility clear on her face.

Rising from my bed I gathered a robe about me.  I took a few steps towards her but stopped, not able to move myself any further.  I wanted to be near her, to put my arms around her, but it felt as if she were across a wide chasm from me, a gulf of time and pain between us.

“I have come for help, Aranion,” she said in a low voice, not quite meeting my gaze.  “There be something I seek, and ye must aid me in achieving it.”  I did not understand, but I nodded my assent.  “Get ye dressed and ready then.  There be a long journey ahead of us.”

She stepped towards the window, her back towards me again, waiting as I put on a stralite mail and gathered my sword.  When she noticed I was ready she levitated out, and I followed.

We whistled through the air, travelling northwards at great speed.  The lands swept beneath us, and the climate grew colder as we went further and further north.  Hours passed in intrepid silence, till we were flying above snowy tundra.  We soared past plains of white and grey before we reached a low range of hills.  Here Linaniil slowed and descended, and I went down beside her.  We came to rest before a dark opening at the foot of the hills.

Linaniil stood for a while staring at the black cave.  Fear radiated from her face, but her eyes were hard and determined.  “It is here,” she said quietly, her voice steady.  I followed her gaze, trying to guess what secrets this remote place contained, but I could sense nothing special.

She marched forwards and I followed, until we came right up to the shadowed opening.  Linaniil hesitated a moment, staring into the blackness, before finally stepping inside and being swallowed from sight.  I could feel it then, the sensation that something ancient lay in this place.  My skin tingled and my arcane attunement felt on fire.  This dark cave held some mysterious force, secluded from all knowledge since the oldest days of Eyal.  There was something here that could change the destiny of the world.

I took a deep breath and stepped forwards.]],

Light sprung from Linaniil’s staff, and she cast about a luminescence, revealing a narrow icy passageway that led downwards.  It was deathly cold, and our breaths condensed in clouds as we made our way down the wending tunnels.  My skin pricked, and all my senses seemed on edge.

“What is down here?” I asked, my curiosity all-consuming.

“Power,” Linaniil responded, not looking at me as she spake, continuing to follow the path.  “And power be what I seek.  I am afeared for mine people, but have not the strength to protect them as I wouldst like.  With what be here, perhaps, I shall have the power to make a safe haven.  This be a place of legend amongst mine people, and I have scouted it out over many years.  Today I shall finally reach what lies at the centre.”

“And why do you need me?”

She didn’t respond, but carried onwards.  We reached a split in the tunnel, and without hesitation Linaniil took the left path.  It led further and further underground.  We came to blockages, but by arcane force the sorceress easily cleared a way.

As we passed through a large cavern I sensed movement, and drew Mooncutter quickly.  What looked like a disembodied limb, or some great thrashing worm, was writhing towards us pathetically.  Linaniil send a blast of fire towards it - it squealed and went still.

And then more movement, a hundred movements.  From crevasses and holes in the walls and ceiling there burst out dozens upon dozens of the worm-like creatures, their maggoty bodies flapping rigorously, fanged mouths opening up and screaming torturous sounds.  Linaniil growled and began sending torrents of flame towards the approaching horde.  I covered her back, slicing open their pale green flesh and sending strokes of lightning through their ranks.  In under a minute we had dispatched them all.

I prodded a corpse with my foot and it collapsed into sludge.  “What strange creatures,” I commented.  I looked at Linaniil for some explanation but she simply proceeded forward.  I followed after, keeping my sword in hand and watching closely for further attacks.

At the other end of the cavern a wall of ice blocked our way.  Linaniil held up the Ring of Kar’Krul, and the jewel on it began to blaze.  The ice melted away slowly, revealing a passage to another, smaller chamber.

This cold, crypt-like hollow was covered in smooth, glistening ice on all sides.  The walls were square and straight, and ancient pillars of marble were dotted about the room.  On the pillars and walls were weathered runes and symbols.  I came close to study some, but couldn’t recognise them from any of my studies.  “What was this place?” I asked, turning to Linaniil.  “It seems older even than Sher’Tul.”

She ran her hand over one of the walls, tracing the outline of a door.  “It be a temple to Quekorja, god of a race called the Weissi.  The were killed off by the Sher’Tul long before our races were born.  They did build this temple in honour of Quekorja, and the last of them did die here defending her.”

I looked about in awe.  Though I had explored many Sher’Tul ruins I hadn’t seen anything like this.  The architecture was simple but elegant.  There was a crude beauty to it all.  I turned back to the door Linaniil was examining.

She was trying to open it, but was obviously struggling to find a way.  “There be some key, some puzzle to open this,” she muttered.  “But I can nay solve it - the secret be lost to time.”  She growled in anger and stood back.  Holding out her staff she unleashed a blast of arcane force from it, violently splitting the stone door apart and tearing open a passage to a chamber beyond.

Many things suddenly happened at once.  From beyond I felt a pulse of energy, a huge surge of power that I had never felt before.  Linaniil was focussed on it intensely.  But noise came from all around of creatures moving asudden.  From the cave we had entered from there was a shriek of a hundred wailing voices, and the floor beneath our feet trembled.  Rocks fell from the ceiling and out burst horrific creatures with spiked limbs and smooth, triangular faces.  From the trembling ground arose a strange ethereal being of light, with long tentacles for limbs.  And as I turned to face these threats I saw that in the previous cavern the worms had come back to life, and were now coalescing into a huge mass of putrid flesh.

I tried to cut through the being of light, but my sword barely slowed as it passed through it, and the flames I summoned seemed to have little effect.  It raised a tentacle towards me and an intensely bright beam of light shone from it through my torso, filling my flesh with searing pain.  I jumped back and send a wave of ice at it, tearing off a tentacle and pushing it further away.  Meanwhile Linaniil had reduced one of the spiked creatures to a pile of ash, but her arcane shield was collapsing beneath the slashes of the others, and more were spilling from the ceiling.  In the entranceway the mass of worms was pressing through, and from the mouths of the flailing bodies came spits of burning acid.

We were at severe risk of getting surrounded in this confined space, the numbers too many to take on at once.  “Over here!” shouted Linaniil, as she dashed through the door she had split apart.  I followed, slashing my blade through the mass of worms, causing it to lurch back screeching in pain, and spearing a blast of lightning through one of the spiked creatures, splitting open its head.  It continued to attack me, but I parried and cut its arm off, dancing around it and reaching the doorway.  With my back to the opening I brought up a wall of water and sent it flooding into the chamber, pushing the horrors away as I leapt backwards through the door.

As soon as I passed through Linaniil thrust her staff into the ground and a pillar of rock rose upwards, sealing off the opening.  I could hear thrashing and thumping sounds from the other side, but for now we seemed safe.  “What were those things?!” I asked incredulously, as I scanned around the open cavern for signs of any more creatures.  It was a large space, but everything was still, and I could see no other entrances.

“Scions of Amakthel,” she responded calmly.  “The butchered god seeks to break his chains.  But he needs more power...  And here in this dark, forgotten place is part of that power he seeks.”

“And what is here?  What terrible power lies here that would draw both you and those horrors?!”

“Quekorja,” she said.

“Quekorja?  The... the god?”  I couldn’t believe I what I was hearing.  “Was it not slain by the Sher’Tul?”

“Aye, that it were.  But there be power even in a slain god.  Look behind ye, Aranion.”

I turned then, wondering what she wanted me to behold.  It took me a moment to see it, but when I did I gasped in shock.  The far wall of this great cavern was not merely a wall.  It was covered in a thick layer of ice, but beneath at its centre I could make out a huge yellow eye.  And around that eye I could trace out a giant form.  Dark grey skin covered a bulging head, topped with three great curved horns, which sat atop a long, thick body with six limbs.  It was deathly still and chillingly ancient, seeming more like part of the rock than anything that had once been alive.  I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, but I could feel it.  In that corpse was still power, immense power, like nothing I had ever felt before.

“This be it,” said Linaniil.  “One of the few corpses of the gods left to find in Maj’Eyal.  And I shall take its power as mine own.”

“This is insane!” I shouted.  “You have no idea if that is safe or not.  You don’t know what it will do to you!”

She chuckled darkly.  “Aye, that be true.  But that is why I have brought ye here.”  I looked at her in confusion and she chuckled again.  “Ye still know not your purpose here.  Did ye think I took ye here for protection?  That I couldst not handle those horrors on mine own?  No, there be a different reason I have brought ye.  When I absorb this corpse, when I take its power for mine own, I do not know what wilst become of me.  It may kill me.  Or it may drive me mad, it may turn me into something terrible.  Should that happen, Aranion, you art the only one I know with the strength to kill me.”

The words hit me like a blow to the chest.  “Kill you?  But I couldn’t...”

“But ye must!” she said firmly.  “After all ye have done... all the torture ye have brought my life... ye owe me this.”  I looked deep into her eyes and saw the turmoil of emotions within, the pain and agony of all that had befallen her, the hatred and blame of those who had wronged her, the guilt and shame for not being able to do more herself.  And deep inside still some touch of love for me and what we had shared.  I reached out my hand and stroked her soft hair, my fingers touching lightly against the side of her face.  I leaned in close and she closed her eyes, turning her face up to me as I moved my lips towards hers.

“No!” she suddenly cried, pushing me back.  “It cannot be!”  She swiftly turned from me, and I saw a tear drip down one cheek.  “The world has changed, Aranion.  I have a duty before me, and none can walk that path beside me.”  And with that she began to run, staff in hand, towards the great eye whose dead gaze was locked behind the wall of ice.  I sprinted after her, but she was faster, and with running leap she thrust the base of her staff through the ice and into the center of the god’s eye.

The ice cracked with a deafening thunder, and the giant yellow eye pulsed before exploding in a ball of light.  I stopped and covered my eyes as white light flooded the room and shards of ice flew through the air.  I could barely make out Linaniil, bathed in light, hanging with one hand from her staff, her hair and robes blown backwards as she reached forwards with her other arm.  Slowly, intrepidly, she placed her hand into the centre of the ball of light where the eye had been, and shadows danced about the cavern as she wrapped her fingers round that luminous sphere, before squeezing tight.

The cavern shook, her staff shattered, the wall creaked and split before wholly blasting apart.  The corpse of the dead god collapsed into a stream of silver and in a roaring cacophony rushed towards Linaniil, tearing apart her robes and sinking into her skin.  She floated in the air, limbs outstretched as the vast energy poured into her flesh.  She opened her mouth as if to scream and light burst out, and light spilled from her eyes and ears.  The cavern quaked dangerously and rocks fell from the walls and ceiling.  But in seconds it was over, the corpse of the god fully absorbed, the light in Linaniil’s eyes went out, and she dropped to the ground like a stone.

Then the horrors broke through, the collapsing cavern having made an opening for them, and immediately they sped hungrily to where Linaniil lay.  “No!” I cried, rushing to intercept them.  “You cannot have her!”

I sliced off the head of a spiked creature and put up a wall of fire ahead of the rest of them as I backed towards Linaniil’s body.  She looked dead, with no sign of movement or breathing, but I had no time to check.  The being of light and tentacles passed through my flames without resistance, and I ran sparks along my sword as I tore it up the centre of the monster.  It shot light through my torso and I coughed up blood, but I forced my sword in deeper and ran a flood of arcane energy through it, blowing the thing apart.  More spiked creatures came, and I took care of my footing whilst parrying and chopping on my left and sending waves of flame to my right.

The mass of worms broke through the wall, and with it two more luminous horrors, and some fiend of darkness and nightmares, and I could see behind others were spilling through.  I put up a shield as rays of light shot towards me, and sent balls of frost back at them.  One of the light beings fell, whilst the other was slowed.  The dark thing came quickly, and the mass of worms not far behind, so I sliced my sword across the ground, sending heat through it, and turned the stone into a mass of lava.  The dark thing came around it, and I felt an aura of deathly cold from it as it approached.  I hacked at it desperately, and it shot back speared limbs towards my chest that seemed to suck all strength from me.  With a roar I shot a pulse of flames down my blade and it burst apart.  The worms charged directly over the lava, squealing in pain as a bulk of them were burned, but coming at me with speed.  I adjusted my grip, getting ready to make deft strokes to stay out of its range, but a lance of light then shot through my leg, dropping me to one knee with a scream.  The mass of worms rushed at me then, and I dug my sword deep into their midst, but the worms crawled over my arms, digging their acidic teeth into my flesh and reaching for my neck.  With my left arm I cast a blanket of flames over them, burning my arm along with the screeching worms.  They pulled away slightly, but the being of light was approaching from the side, a tentacle flaring up in luminescent energy, and three spiked horrors were behind it.  My right arm was burnt, my left leg injured, my mail pocked with holes, and my mana reserves were running low.  But I gritted my teeth in determination - I could not back from this fight.  I rushed at the mass of worms with my sword held firm.

It exploded in a fiery mess, and an intense wave of force and fire blasted across the cavern, turning the other horrors to ash, and even burning through the luminous being - a low scream arising from it as the flames tore it apart.  I gasped, not knowing whence this blaze had come, until I turned around and saw Linaniil.  She was standing tall, her robes burnt off, flames dancing up and down her skin, bright light shining from her eyes.  Heat seemed to radiate from her.  I kept my grip on my sword, not sure if this was the Linaniil I knew, or some other force born of her union with the dead god.

She laughed suddenly, and it was a harsh laugh that I had not heard her make before.  “What a fool I have been,” she said, almost to herself.  “I brought ye here in case ye had to stop me.  But now...  Now mine power exceeds ye by a long distance.  Ye would have no hope of opposing me!”  She made a low sound somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.  “Ah, but ye have no cause to worry.  I am still me.  Mostly.  And through pain and sacrifice I have achieved the power I desired.  The power I need.”

I let my sword dip and breathed heavily, relief mingled with trepidation sweeping through me, whilst the withdrawing adrenalin of battle left me feeling exhausted.  I looked Linaniil over, her pale skin now glowing, her eyes brimming with energy and vitality.  I saw the power she had was not in mere force, but that she had taken on the ageless nature of the gods.  A power forbidden to all creatures was now hers and hers alone.

“What now?” I said quietly.

“Now, ye go home, and I go to make mine home, a sanctuary for me and mine people.”

“Will we meet again?”

She smiled sadly.  “Mayhaps.  Mayhaps not.  The world changes quicker than predictions can tell.  But if we do meet again it shall be in a place that does not yet exist - the city of Angolwen.”  She raised an arm then and from it shot a tremendous pulse of arcane energy, the violet light shooting to the roof of the cavern and spearing through, deep through, till it split the rock apart right through to the open sky a mile above.  Sunlight spilled down, splashing over Linaniil’s lithe form.  It had been many hours since this long long night had begun.

“But for now, farewell Aranion,” she said as she began to float from the ground.  And then she sped up and soared out of sight.

I lay down on the cold stone, resting for a while, slowly healing my wounds and recovering my strength.  I reflected on the events since the evening before, thinking back on the trials of all the races of Maj’Eyal.  War, disease and death threatened all equally.  Was Linaniil beyond that now?  How would a taste of immortality affect her?

It was then that thought for our race came to me.  In ages past we had searched for immortality.  Our ancestral leaders had obsessed over it, but out of vanity, pride and a fear of death.  What would the real effects be if all our society were to be gifted with it?  With immortal life we might separate ourselves from the strifes and wars of the world.  It would give us a perspective beyond the petty squabbles and prideful competition of the other races.

I dug through the ice and rocks and found still some trace of the dead god Quekorja, faint though it were.  I gathered all that was left and made the long journey back to Elvala.  There I retreated to my labs, studying the remains for years before finally unlocking its secrets.  It was thus that immortality for our race was born, and it has changed our outlook on the world ever since.

We stood apart from the others then, not engaging in war, finding a new respect for life.  It was not till Garkul the Devourer assaulted our gates in the Age of Pyre that we ever had cause for large scale war again, and I rode out to face him in combat.

But ah, that is another tale, one indeed of many tales, in the long and rich history of the Tales of Maj’Eyal...]],
