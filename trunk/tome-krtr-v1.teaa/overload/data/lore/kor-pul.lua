아 그래, 땡전 한 푼 없어서 그랬지. 하..

아무리 그래도, 내가 입고 있던 옷이 전송되지 않았을 줄이야! 처음 보는 낯선 땅에서, 입에 담기도 민망한 내 모습을 발견했을 때의 부끄러움이란.. 고맙게도 한 친절한 농부가 로브 하나를 빌려주었고, 그를 위해 약간의 일을 해줘 조금이지만 돈도 구했다. 딱 식량 약간과 일지 한 권, 그리고 오래되고 낡은 검 하나 살 돈 말이지. 그래도 이 근처에 언데드로 가득 찬 폐허가 많다는 소리를 들었을 때, 나는 어떤 부름을 받은 듯한 느낌을 받았다! 그렇지 않고서야 이 위대한 태양의 수호자, 텔싸르 (Telthar) 가 이런 곳에 올 리가 없지 않은가? 이 알지 못할 서쪽 땅에서, 나의 힘을 증명할 기회가 온 것이다!

	lore = [[Aha, I have found the accursed undead that plague this nefarious dungeon! The skeletal fool was thankfully no match for me! I suppose it helped that he had no arms...

I've found myself an old shield that in spite of a few dents seems serviceable enough. Some of these rats are BIG, and giving them a strong bash with the shield helps to stop their poisonous bites before I get my sword to their necks. I also found a few gems - I may have to hunt round for more. Not out of any personal greed of course, but my noble quest requires that I gather resources to defeat the great evils in this land and back home!

Diamonds are my favourite, so sparkly.]],

The skeletal mages have been a night-born nuisance, but I've found a new weapon to use against them - a phase door rune! As soon as I catch sight of one of the robed wretches I activate my rune and foom, I'm away!

It's not fleeing, it's just tactical repositioning...

	lore = [[Kor'Pul, Kor'Pul... When the farmer told me what this place was called it reminded me of something, and I think it's coming back to me now. My mother used to tell me a story about our ancestors, how they fled by ship to escape the grasp of an evil sorcerer who dominated the lands. The sorcerer was a vile necromancer who took advantage of the destruction from the Spellblaze and the Cataclysm to create huge armies of undead. The people fought against him time and time again, but though he would be defeated he would still come back, sometimes after hundreds of years. And that sorcerer's name was.... Kor'Pul.

Probably just a coincidence.]],

Our motto is to bring light into dark places, but I guess I should have thought about that in practical terms. I've cleared out pretty much all of this area, and there's not much left to explore beyond this last room.

This adventuring stuff is quite lonely, I must say. I guess keeping this journal helps a bit. I miss home a lot now. I miss... I miss Falia. Maybe I should have said something to her about how I feel... but I guess running away on an adventure seemed easier. Pah, how brave of me...

I'm not cut out for this paladin work. Here I am, alone in a horrible dark dungeon in an unknown land, without a single sound to keep me company beyond the scratchings of my own quill. Hmm, except for--]],
