You seem like the adventuring fare, up to all sorts of doo-daddle in the outside world, I imagine. Well, don't forget to pay patronage to our good library here in the city. The riches of the world are all well and good, but where would we be without the gift of knowledge? And all proceeds go towards the funding of further research. No greater cause, yes?]],
