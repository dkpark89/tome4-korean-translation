When Nalore sank, many of us died, so we resorted to using the magic of this temple. It worked, it saved us, and yet we are cursed. Cursed in this form by the terrible magic.
If you do not believe anything else of what I say, please believe at least this: the Sher'Tul are hiding, not gone, and they are not benevolent entities.
