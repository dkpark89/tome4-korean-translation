This is good, more of us should get out of here once in a while and actually help people out there.
Say, maybe you might want to get an adventure and help Angolwen?]],

We managed to stabilize it and it is now orbiting Eyal. Recently we have noticed a disturbance there; if we do nothing it will crash onto Eyal, bringing much destruction in its wake.
Because it was once part of a land we know well we can teleport you there. You will need to stabilize three wormholes by firing any attack spells at them.
The instability is also to your advantage there, your simple phase door spell will be fully controllable.

So, you think you can help us ?]],
