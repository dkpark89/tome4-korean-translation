#{bold}#Chapter One: A Fateful Meeting#{normal}#

This tale begins in the Age of Allure, when I was yet young, and the idea of youth and age was still a pressure on our people.  It is one tale amongst a host of tales, for many are the stories of tragedy and heroism that befell all the races in this era.  I can only give my story, my tragedies, and my follies dressed as heroism, woven around the great force that shook our world and changed our histories: The Spellblaze.

I first met Linaniil at a council summit, when our leader Ephinias was meeting with the head of the Kar?셁rul.  I remember the huge man walking through the gates of our city, our people staring at his wide girth and bristling hair, his fur clothes and his proud stride.  How out of place he looked amongst us slender elves...  Some thought him a barbarian, but I could see behind his frosty eyes there was great power.  He was from a hardy race of men that once dwelt in the north of Eyal, who it was said drew power from the green fires that danced in their everwinter skies.  Turthel was his name, and the like of him has not trod through earth or snow in many centuries.  Upon his right hand he wore the Ring of Kar?셁rul, a lustrous gold band adorned by a blazing ruby, token to his position as the leader of the greatest union of human mages in Maj?섷yal.

With him were his twin daughters, Linaniil and Neira, who walked before him.  Identical they were in looks, yet I saw straight away that they were opposites in personality.  They were each of crimson hair, worn long in spilling tresses, with pale skin that shone in the sunlight.  They were dressed in silken robes, but whilst Neira was adorned in yellow and orange, Linaniil wore blue and silver.  Neira was bright of glance and cheery of voice, remarking on every item of beauty she passed as they strolled through the courtyards of Elvala.  Linaniil was quiet though, and stern of face, coldly analysing and calculating all she saw.  But beneath that icy exterior I could see a fire ??nay, a blaze, a bright burning passion yearning to break out, yet kept restrained.  For a moment we made eye contact as the party approached the citadel, and I could see laid bare her wild spirit and untempered thoughts, a will and strength of mind that was utterly unconquerable.  It took my breath from me.

Few of my people have ever understood how one of our race could be infatuated with a human.  But they have not known Linaniil.  Not as I have known her.  Like raw fire given flesh is she, a burning ball of emotions and desires.  Her fervent mind brooks no opposition, and her wit and words charm or coerce all around her.  Beautiful and radiant is her form, as bright as the summer sun, yet also cold and remote, unreachable unless she wants to be reached.  In all the ages this has never changed about her.

I barely noticed Neira greeting me warmly as she passed through the gate.  Linaniil gave me but a curt nod.  I followed after, as our leader and his guests entered the grand chamber and took their seats.  The summit was to begin on the planning of a new endeavour, a great work by our highest mages to tap into the power of the Sher?셏ul farportals.  Long had the relics of that ancient race lain dormant beneath the soil, their powers untouched.  With that mighty strength brought forth we could end the war with the orcs quickly and decisively.  The Spellblaze they called it, and it was a name we spoke in awe and reverence.

King Ephinias began the meeting, introducing our guests and then those around him.  ?쏷his is my general,??he said gesturing to me, ?쏞ommander Gawaeil of the Shaloren Armies.?? Immediately Linaniil looked at me and gawked.

?쏻hat???she cried, staring at my armour and baldric.  She turned away from us, seeming not to heed her distinguished hosts.  ?쏤ather, what be the meaning of this???she said to the burly man.  ?쏽e gave tell that the Shaloren had the mightiest battlemages, yet their general be cased in steel and girt with sword.  Does a mere fighter command experts in the Art???

Ephinias looked outraged, but I laughed suddenly, both at her extreme rudeness and her wild presumptions.  ?쏛 mere fighter???I said between incredulous gasps.  ?쏬ady, you would do well not to judge so on appearances.  For if I judge right I see no mere impudent lass before me, but a great master of flames and inflagrations, and a weaver of threads more stern-willed even than her chill-blooded father.  But do not presume yourself a greater worker of the Art than I!  For I am Aranion Gawaeil, master of the Arcane Blade, a channeller of mighty elemental forces.  The spells willed through my steel have slain more orcs than you have seen in your short life, or like will ever see.??

She looked at me then with sudden interest.  ?쏛 strange technique it sounds.  Ludicrous it seems when one can simply burn foes from afar.  Though perhaps if we hunt orc together some time I shall see for mine self.  But ye would be hard pressed indeed to better me on the battlefield.??

?쏧 shall endeavour to impress, my lady,??I said, with a mock bow of my head.  A thin smile played across her lips.

Turthel grunted and turned his shaggy head to the king.  ?쏝usiness,??he said, in the blunt and brief manner I had heard reported of him.

Ephinias cleared his throat and sat back in his chair.  ?쏻e have a grand plan before us,??he began. ?쏤or many years we have been plagued by orc attacks.  Initially we were weakened from the Allure Wars, but now that we are beginning to recover our strength it is time to put our joint enemy to rest.  Too often they have threatened to overrun us all, to destroy civilisation forever.  We have all lost much.  Turthel, I can deeply sympathise with your personal loss.?? The fur-clothed man did not change his expression, but I could see his daughters dip their heads in solemn thought.

?쏧 have been leading our archmages in an experiment on the Sher?셏ul farportal to the east of here.  We believe we can evoke the great powers sealed within to create a wave of destructive energy that we could direct against the orcish armies.  If all the races cooperate in drawing the orcish forces out then we can end this war in one swift strike.  The orcs would be decimated beyond recovery, and Eyal would be cleansed of their presence.

?쏧 have approached the leaders of the other races.  The halflings are fully supportive.  The Nargol regents have even provided us with some of their historical research on Sher?셏ul ruins.??

Turthel cursed then suddenly.  ?쏳esearch done on human slaves!??he barked.  He turned quiet then, letting his temper settle.  ?쏻hat of your sea and forest cousins???

Ephinias looked him coolly in the eye.  ?쏷he Naloren are prideful and do not wish to cooperate.  They think they can protect their lands on their own.  Yet I believe they will thank us in the end...  The Thaloren are not entirely keen either.  But we have discussed with their king and queen, and given great assurances as to the safety of our operations.  They do not wholly trust us or our command of the arcane, but in this they will not oppose us.  Shatur is as weary of the orc attacks on its borders as any of us.  They will give aid where it is convenient, as long as they ride under their own banners.  We do not particularly need them, of course, but we thought it prudent to involve all we could.

?쏷he other human leaders have mostly assented.  Some have expressed wholly irrational fears of our activities.  Alas, legends and myths still abound to scare people away from anything to do with the Sher?셏ul.  But we are confident that we know what we are doing here.  The Kar?셁rul elite I?셫 sure will understand.  And your alliance is worth a dozen lesser kings.??

The burly man stared hard and long into Ephinias??eyes, before turning to his daughters.  ?쏻hat do ye think, girls???

Neira was the first to respond, and there was colour in her cheeks and emotion in her voice.  ?쏧 deem this Shaloren king remote and proud.  Sympathy he talks of whilst using our mother?셲 memory as a tool.  Understanding he proclaims, yet how can any truly know the subtlety behind these Sher?셏ul relics?  Untouched they be for millennia, and their original power is still unknown.  What pride lets ye think ye can toy with them now?  It be folly to use a weapon that ye know not how to wield.??

The room went quiet, and I could see Ephinias was silently fuming.  He was not accustomed to such open criticism.  Then Linaniil began to speak, and her voice was low and cool, yet all ears hung on her words.  ?쏮any have been the works of pride over the years that have arisen in splendour.  Wherefore have come our great artworks, our grand cities, or the arcane weavings that shape our societies?  No meekness be found in their crafting.  There be no shame in acting out of pride, and we gain nothing from misplaced humility.  Too long have the powers of the Sher?셏ul been left untapped by fearful and timid hearts.?? I could see then her eyes light up with excitement.  ?쏷hink of the glories we could unlock!  This war with the orcs would be but the beginning.  Great benefit could be brought to us all.  To leave these powers buried would be a crime, I say.??

Turthel paused reflectively before nodding his head slowly, and it was clear that Linaniil?셲 words aligned better with his own thoughts.  ?쏺ery well,??he slowly announced, looking directly at Ephinias.  ?쏻e are with you.?? Neira stayed silent with brooding concern, but a flash of satisfaction crossed her sister?셲 eyes.]],

#{bold}#Chapter Two: A Night to Remember#{normal}#

It was three nights later I awoke in darkness from a troubled dream to find my window open, the silk drapes billowing in the breeze.  As my eyes adjusted to the light I saw Linaniil stood at the foot of my bed, a thin azure dress clinging to her skin in the chill night air.  Around her was a cashmere belt inset with opals and woven with pale runes, and gold jewellery adorned her neck and wrists.  A long staff rested lightly in her hands, rubies glistening in its decorated top.  Her red hair stirred in the wind as she gazed at me.
 
?쏻hat are you doing here???I enquired.  I did not bother asking how she managed to sneak into my bedchamber, past many guards.  I knew that no less than a council member would be able to divine her presence when she put her mind to illusion.
 
She looked at me slowly for a moment, before turning her eyes to the rest of the room, analysing my personal space in detail.  ?쏷here be a band of orcs marauding in the north,??she said in a distracted tone.  She picked an ornamental dagger from a shelf and looked it over as she spoke.  ?쏷hey look like to cause trouble for some outlying elven settlements.??
 
?쏧 will summon a raiding party at once,??I said, rising quickly from my bed, unheeding of modesty.
 
?쏰h, how boring!??she complained, putting the dagger down and spinning to face me.  ?쏻hat of the promise ye made to hunt orc together???
 
?쏻hat, just the two of us???
 
?쏛ye,??she said, looking my unclad form up and down with a slow gaze, seeming to take delight in the sight.  ?쏰r are ye not man enough???
 
?쏛 strange question to ask of an elf, my lady.  But I can take this band of orcs myself, I am sure.  If you wish to tag along then I cannot promise to keep you safe.??
 
She laughed then, and the sound was like ringing crystal.  ?쏺ery well then!  Get ye your steel stick and we shall see who holds their own best.?? I agreed with a smile, and went to my armoury and shoved on metal greaves and a chain hauberk, my breastplate and steel gauntlets.  Linaniil tutted in surly impatience.  ?쏮ust ye wear that tin suit???
 
?쏧t is my battle gear,??said I, pulling on my visored helm and wrapping a thick cloak round my shoulders.
 
?쏽e look like a golem,??she muttered, visibly annoyed.  ?쏞ome then, I grow bored.?? She leapt out the window, taking to the air with grace, flying away into the night.
 
I took then my greatsword from its hanging.  It was a simple looking blade, adorned only with a heavy moonstone on its pommel.  But its looks belied its power, for it was forged by the dwarves in their early years, before vanity overcame their works and their weapons became more for show than for battle.  It had an edge that clove through steel and bone with ease, without ever dulling the blade.  Mooncutter it is called, though it is lost to me now.  I gave it a swing through the air before leaping out the window myself, conjuring a cushion of air beneath me and following swiftly after Linaniil.
 
With rapid pace we flew through the scattered clouds in silence for twenty minutes before Linaniil began to descend.  I could see nestled between some low hills were the flames of campfires, and as we came closer the sound of orcish chanting became clear.  ?쏦ow shall we approach them???I called out, wondering what tactics the sorceress would want to employ.
 
?쏡irectly,??she said, and with that she made a sudden burst of speed, coming right above the orcish camp and descending in their midst.  With a curse I sped after her, landing by her side and drawing Mooncutter as the orcs rose in fury and alarm, grabbing up their weapons.  As a ring of dark swords and spears and halberds gathered round us Linaniil turned to me with a wild smile.  ?쏷ime to dance.??
 
She shot forth a ray of purple arcane energy from her right hand, whilst her left held up her staff, its tip blazing like a torch.  Flames leapt up in tandem from my own blade as I rose it high, and swept it before me in a wide arc, cutting down the nearest brute and sending a shocking wave of fire into the troops behind it.  I pressed forward, forcing back the orcs before me with a roaring hot wind.  Their weapons dropped from their hands as they reached up to cover their faces, and with a grin of satisfaction I rushed to hew their heads off.  But as I swung my blade I was knocked to the ground from behind by a blast of fire, and turning about I saw Linaniil standing in a pillar of flame, her arms outstretched as it expanded around her.  ?쏷oo hot for ye, Aranion???she called out as the orcs nearby were fried to a crisp, their flesh withering into black dust.
 
I grunted, and turned my blade into ice, and with deft sword strokes sent streams of freezing cold into the orcs around her, so that they shattered like glass before the fire ever hit them.  Linaniil cursed my name as she dropped the flames from about her.  ?쏡on?셳 ruin my fun!??she exclaimed, before teleporting to the other side of the camp and beginning to blast the orcs there.

I laughed and turned on the beasts nearest me, and brought tumults to the earth with each swing, so that they lost their footing and fell to the ground before my sword found their throats.  Then I conjured a mighty spark of lightning, spearing it through their densest ranks, and I rushed along its glowing length hewing down the monsters before they could react.  I laughed again with the fey heat of battle, and I discarded my helm and tore off my platemail, taking joy from moving about the field with ease and slaughtering my inferior foes.  Mooncutter danced through their flesh, and their dark blood gushed and fountained with joyful rhythm.

On the far side of the camp explosions and screams marked Linaniil?셲 passage, and I saw burning limbs flying into the air and streaks of fire tearing through the night.  The sorceress was wreathed in flames, her eyes shining, and the dancing blaze about her made her look like a nymph of fire incarnate.  No more beautiful and awe-inspiring a sight had I ever beheld.

Seeing their numbers quickly dwindling the orcs began to flee, but I phased to block their retreat and called forth a wave of water, forcing them back against Linaniil?셲 flames.  There against the wall of fire I dashed them, and great numbers of them fell like leaves scattered in the wind.  Blood spilled thick and plentiful, and with but a few more thrusts of Mooncutter and blasts from Linaniil?셲 hands the battle was over.  Not a single orc still moved, and well over four hundred lay dead on the ground.
 
Linaniil and I stood facing each other, panting with sudden exhaustion as the adrenaline of the fight left us.  ?쏧 lost count,??I said between breaths, ?쐎f who slew more?╈? She grinned coyly at me, sweat trickling down her face.  Minor cuts and burns left her robe in tatters, with one shoulder strap hanging loose.  Her glistening chest heaved up and down with each breath, and her deep eyes looked at me with naked intensity.
 
She strode forward then, and grabbing me roughly by my hauberk she pulled my lips to hers.  The kiss was hot and fierce, and as she bit my lower lip the course of blood in battle came back to me afresh.  I kissed her again and grabbed her body, pulling her tight to me, our lips locked.  She tore lustfully at my remaining armour, flinging it to the ground, and I slid off her silken clothes, till we were left bare beneath the stars.  Then against a rocky outcrop we pressed against each other, still gasping and sweating from the fight.  There with blazing passion flesh met flesh and our hot moans rose into the cold night sky.]],

#{bold}#Chapter Three: The Farportal#{normal}#

?쏻hy are ye not leader???asked Linaniil, resting her head in her hand with her naked form strewn across my bed.
 
I looked at her, surprised by the sudden question.  My mind struggled briefly with the strange query, still recovering from the heat of sex but a minute before.  ?쏻hy should I be leader???I asked back.
 
?쏝ecause ye are strong, of course,??she responded.  ?쏧 deem ye stronger in battle than any of your kin.  Ye should rule with such strength.??
 
I chuckled softly.  ?쏮ere strength is not enough to rule a people.  It requires responsibilities, careful decision making, and above all ??politics.  I have no interest in such matters.  Ephinias is far better suited to those sorts of things.  Give me a sword and soldiers to lead into battle and I am content.  Let the leaders worry about where I should point my blade.??

She was quiet a moment, seemingly dissatisfied with that response.  ?쏽e are not happy with the current plans though.??

For a moment I was struck with shock.  It surprised me how clearly she divined my inner thoughts.  I had not expressed my concerns to anyone, yet she could so easily read me.  Five weeks it had been since we first met, and it seemed like there was nothing I could hide from her keen sight.
 
The preparations for the Spellblaze were well underway.  Turthel of the Kar?셁rul had returned to his northern citadel, but he left his daughters as ambassadors to aid in our designs.  It meant Linaniil and I had many an opportunity to meet, though we kept it secret.  Few of my race would understand or approve of such a liaison, and none of us could afford a scandal. Yet I could not resist this human mage?셲 advancements, nor she mine.
 
?쏧 am a warrior,??I said to her finally, getting brusquely from my bed and recovering my robes.  ?쏧 settle my battles facing my foe, not by toying with relics from afar.  It irks me that we must deal with our enemies in such a craven way.??

?쏝ut does it not excite ye, using these Sher?셏ul ruins???she said, putting a finger to her lower lip as she still languished in my bed, the sheets sticking tightly to her bare skin.  She seemed visibly aroused by her thoughts.  ?쏶uch powers lain dormant for so long, ready to be summoned to our control...  How it were I to command so great a venture!??

I shook my head sadly as I finished buttoning up my doublet.  ?쏧 do not trust those ruins.  We Shaloren are mighty, but we have yet to reach the heights of the Sher?셏ul, nor do we truly understand the devices they have left behind.  My thoughts are more with your sister Neira on this.  We should stick to what abilities we have mastered, without stretching ourselves to such grand experimentation.??
 
Linaniil looked at me intently, a touch of humour in her dark eyes.  ?쏧f ye were leader then ye could stop this.  But then I would have to hate ye.??
 
I allowed myself a thin smile.  ?쏻ell, that would indeed be a terrible and dangerous thing.?? I finished dressing whilst Linaniil still lay in my bed, her face reflective.  ?쏧 must go now to check on the latest operations at the farportal.  You are welcome to join me.??
 
She shook her head languidly.  ?쏯ay, I wish to rest more.  And besides, hearing their reports would but make me jealous.  Leave me here awhile ??I wilst depart in secret later.??
 
I left my chamber then, dark thoughts now brooding at the back of my mind.  The date was coming closer when our plans would come to fruition and the Great Spellblaze would be unleashed.  A heavy foreboding lay over my heart.  Yet the alternatives seemed grim.  The war with the orcs was going badly, with few races able to secure their borders well and attacks from the brutes ever increasing.  Their numbers seemed inexhaustible.  Though they had little skill in warfare they could bring great harm to unprotected townsteads, and in enough force could bring down cities.  One human kingdom had collapsed under their attacks but a week before.  After that many who had initially rejected our plans came begging for our protection.  The Spellblaze seemed our only hope against imminent disaster.
 
Such thoughts were weighing on my mind as I passed from my chambers in the palace, down to the courtyard by the main gate.  Then from the corner of my eye I saw a swish of long red hair, and spun round thinking Linaniil had followed me.  But the golden robes and bright eyes of Neira revealed otherwise.
 
?쏣xpecting someone else???she asked with a wide smile, seeing the surprised look on my face.
 
?쏧 was deep in thought,??I explained, bowing slightly to greet her.  ?쏧 am just on my way to inspect the farportal operations.  Perhaps you-??
 
?쏧 shall join ye,??she said quickly, not waiting for my invitation.  I nodded my assent and guided her to my carriage.
 
As soon as we took off east the mood changed.  ?쏶he wilst only hurt ye,??said Neira suddenly.
 
I cursed quietly, understanding her meaning.  ?쏛re there no secrets to be had in all Eyal???I muttered.
 
?쏯ot between sisters, and especially not between twins.?? She smiled warmly at me, yet there was no humour in her eyes.  ?쏧 mean it though.  I love mine sister, but I know her ways.  She be fickle, and willed to do her own thing when she likes.  Do not be surprised when she bores of ye.  Nor hurt.??
 
?쏧 am quite capable of taking care of myself,??I said in clipped tone.
 
She gazed into my eyes a moment and then turned away to stare out the window.  ?쏻ell, I have warned ye...??she replied softly, a touch of sadness in her voice.
 
Was it jealousy perhaps that stirred such an outburst?  And for her sister?셲 attention or for mine?  I never did discover.  The rest of the trip was spent in sullen silence.  The sun was setting behind our carriage, casting a long shadow on the path ahead, and bathing the land about in crimson light.  It seemed for a moment like we rode into some demon?셲 plane, pitch black shadows melting into blood-red soil, whilst cold white stars began to spear through the sky above.  I shivered suddenly as the ruins came into view.
 
Few Sher?셏ul ruins have been discovered which even come close to matching the grandeur of those which were near Elvala.  Many centuries our people spent excavating them, digging deep into the ground, ever careful not to damage or upset the relics.  The centrepiece was the Crystal Tower.  From the surface all that could be seen of it was a wide, even-sided square, which when cleaned of soil revealed a white stone smoother than marble.  But delving down our archaeologists found it plummeted deep, deep below the ground.  Half a mile it went down, the featureless white stone not bearing a single mark or engraving anywhere on its surface, until it ended suddenly and without foundation.  It was like the whole tower was separate from the earth, some strange thing of the stars that had dropped from the skies and lay sleeping beneath the soil.
 
Some years earlier our people had solved the invisible runes that allowed it to be opened, revealing vast crystal-lined halls and chambers arrayed in geometric patterns of sublime beauty.  Light sparked and shone from every surface, and the walls seemed to hum with energy.  Many shafts and passageways could only be navigated by flight, and at the top was found a grand room large enough to encompass the whole palace of Elvala.  At its centre was the farportal, a raised dais forty feet in diameter and crackling with energy upon which slowly spun a cloud of stars.  It was beautiful and frightening, enchanting and terrifying.  No power of the Shaloren could discern its operation, and though through careful experimentation we were able to manipulate its energies, never could we get a true grasp of the forces that lay beneath.

Neira and I descended to the base of the tower, smothered in the cold shadows of the excavated ruins.  I nodded to the guards as we passed through the square white entrance, and Neira?셲 eyes instantly enlarged in wonder.  The scintillating rooms were eye-catching to be sure, but they were also desolate and empty.  I tried to imagine what it must have looked like when filled with Sher?셏ul.  ?쏦ow did they all die???I asked under my breath as we traversed the crystal halls, a question many had asked before.
 
The sorceress picked up on my words and laughed softly.  ?쏧t be a mystery, of course!  Mine mother once taught me that they killed themselves in a great civil war, using magics far beyond our imaginings.??
 
?쏧 wonder,??said I.  We had our own records, of course, which we didn?셳 share with the younger races, but they were not so clear-cut as the many myths that had spread over the ages.
 
We reached the central shaft, and from there levitated up past floors and floors of abandoned chambers, living spaces, workshops, storerooms, and many other areas of purpose undivined by our loremasters.  Finally, after ascending for several minutes, we rose into the grand chamber of the farportal, and Neira gasped to see its size.  Her eyes soon settled on the great Sher?셏ul farportal, sparks from it reflecting off the roof hundreds of feet above.  About it were bustling many of our Shaloren mages in silken robes, and Ephinias himself was leading the operations.
 
He broke from his advisers as he saw us arrive, and strode towards us with a confident smile on his face.  Though he wore the grey robes of a research mage he still bore his great golden staff, Luminis, token of his position as king.
 
?쏛h, General Aranion!??he said, ?쏽ou have come at last.  And brought the Kar?셁rul girl with you; how splendid.??
 
I gave a small bow.  ?쏽our majesty.  I am here for the update on our operations.??
 
?쏽es, yes, of course,??he said with a dismissive hand gesture.  ?쏛nd doubtless the girl is here to make sure we know what we?셱e doing???
 
If Neira was offended she covered it up well.  ?쏧t would be mine delight to see evidence of ye skill and power over the ruins, lord Ephinias.??
 
The king smiled and nodded then, and called to some of his aides.  ?쏱repare the topography demonstration, using the acute fire strand.?? He turned back to us then.  ?쏧t is not mere skill and power of course that we can show you, but subtlety and scale too.  Now excuse me a moment whilst I join the others.??
 
He went with two of the senior research mages then to the front of the farportal.  They faced each other and began a low humming in unison, and slowly it seemed that the sparks from the farportal began to flicker redly.  Over the course of a few minutes their hum became a higher pitched chant, but softly sung and still in perfect unison.  As they raised their staffs there appeared above the farportal an image in flames, and looking at it both Neira and I marvelled, for we could see clearly that it was an image of ourselves, looking upwards, as if looking we were staring into a mirror.  Our features and movements were all clearly discernible, down the smallest detail, all carved out of flickering orange fire.
 
Then the chanting rose higher and it seemed the image zoomed out, so that we saw the farportal nearby us and the mages gathered about.  And still the focus soared upwards till we were but specks in a wide hall, until the image was displaced by a white square with carven edges dug into the earth about it, and I knew we were looking at the top of the Crystal Tower from above.  The view widened, and I could see the land rushing away, and the city of Elvala to the west.  The chanting rose higher and now the sea could be seen, and the mountains to the north-west, and all the land about.  And soon the continent was visible, right to the frozen north, and the ocean wrapped all about, and it seemed small white stars were dotted about the landscape.  The singing reached a crescendo and before us hung an image of the whole of Eyal, a globe of fire suspended in mid-air, slowly turning.
 
Then the chanting stopped and the image disappeared, and I could hear beside me Neira suddenly gasp for air, as if she had not dared draw breath through the last few minutes.
 
?쏽ou see now???said Ephinias, grinning with pleasure.  ?쏤rom the smallest detail to the grandest scale we can manipulate the farportal?셲 energy.  And did you see those white points marked across the image?  They are the other farportals spread across the world, and this one can connect to them all.  With careful, delicate control we can harmonise the energy of them all and use it to our will.  I?셫 afraid your sword can be no match to this, Aranion.??
 
I had no words to respond, and only nodded softly, still in awe of what I had seen.  Neira seemed the same, and I could see her now staring at the farportal with the same eager eyes as her sister.  She was converted.
 
Yet my hand strayed across the hilt of Mooncutter, and my heart still murmured with unease.]],

I rode my great grey horse at a low trot, surrounded by my lieutenants and their elite cavalry and spellrangers.  Beside me on a brown mare my squire held high a banner emblazoned with a flame-wreathed sword, symbol of my personal entourage.  The pole seemed to shiver slightly in the young elf?셲 hands, a sign of nervousness.
 
?쏦old that banner firm, boy,??I said in a commanding tone.
 
The squire suddenly sat upright in his saddle, and gripped tight on the banner pole.  ?쏽es, sire!??he said, alarmed.  ?쏻hatever you say, sire!?? He kept his head faced forward but I could see his eyes glance towards me, desperate for approval.  Whatever I say indeed...  I had seen his gaze on me before, with all the adoration of a young soldier towards his commander, and perhaps a little more.  If I had not the joy of Linaniil?셲 company then the attention of such a pretty lad would not be unwelcome.  But this was not the time for such thoughts.
 
This would be the day, the day of the Spellblaze, and the boy had every right to be nervous.  It was a few hours after midnight, and already our scouts would be engaged alongside the other races, drawing out the orcs from their hiding places.  We marched through our main offensive lines, where we would hem them in before the great conflagration.  All around were arrayed spears and swords and mail, glistening in the starlight.  Troops upon troops of battlemages in purple robes held aloft glowing staves.  It was a sight to behold.  Yet we knew also the risk of engaging on open ground with the orcs in their full numbers.  If the Spellblaze failed then we would suffer greatly.

I set up camp upon a low hill overlooking the field, and then left my entourage to seek the Kar?셁rul army to the north.  As I rode my stallion towards their station I could see smoke rising in the east.  Four thick grey plumes stood out against the pre-dawn light.  They would be villages looted and burned by the orcs as they rampaged against our feigned assaults.  The townsteads would be empty, but after this battle there would be nothing left for their residents to return to.  A small sacrifice in a game of war that spanned the continent.

A fifth column of smoke began to rise, and in the greenish haze of early morn those pillars of smoke suddenly seemed to look like a demonic hand stretching over the world, ready to dig its claws into the earth and rip out the flesh beneath.  This, I knew, was the threat the orcs faced to us all, a menace to all civilisation.  Whatever price we paid to stop them would be a small one.  So I thought.  So we all thought.
 
When I reached the Kar?셁rul camp Linaniil came out to meet me.  Her smile was warm at the sight of me, but I could tell from her eyes that she was more excited for the events of the day.  ?쏪ust a few more hours,??she whispered like an impatient child.  ?쏷his will be fascinating!??
 
As I came in the Kar?셁rul pavilion I saw Neira inside, and some of their senior mages and delegates from other human kingdoms.  I knew Turthel would not be with them, as he stayed in his northern city with his people.  It was not cowardice nor age that held him back from the front lines of war.  Indeed, it was said that ever since his wife was killed by the orcs he had to restrain himself from battle, lest his anger overcome him and he destroy friend and foe alike in his rage.  Yet it was known that sometimes he would venture through the lands alone, and he would bring with him a deafening storm of wrath, and the orcs would cower at the rumour of the approach of Turthel, Tempest of the North.
 
Neira and Linaniil commanded the Kar?셁rul forces, and from the firm-set look on their archmages??faces it was clear that they were ready for whatever the day would bring.  Yet Neira looked troubled, doubt evident in her eyes.
 
?쏻hat irks your sister???I whispered to Linaniil.
 
?쏶ome dumb dream,??she responded callously.
 
Neira?셲 eyes shot up.  ?쏧t were not a dream!??she barked.  ?쏛n omen it were, I tell ye!?? She turned to me then with pleading eyes.  ?쏽e must believe me, Aranion.  Something wilst go terribly wrong today.  I saw last night a terrible sight in mine dreams, as if it were a memory of long ago.  There were a burning city, made of glass and silver and marble.  And as it burned I did hear the cries of thousands, tens of thousands, young and old all dying.  And then the city fell, for it had been held in the sky, and it crashed down to the earth with a shattering torment that spilled across the land.  And other cities there were, and pillars of violet light struck up from them, and they did dance around filling the air with the scent of ozone and seared flesh.  Death was everywhere!  Death like none we have ever seen.
 
?쏧t were no mere dream I tell ye.  It be a message, a warning - some forgotten tale of the dangers we play with.  We must stop this thing!??
 
Linaniil was tapping her foot impatiently as her sister raved, but I could see some of the other leaders looking worried.  I knew I had to quiet Neira down, so I drew myself near and put my hands on her shoulders, looking her calmly in the eyes and bringing my face close.
 
?쏧t may well be that this is no dream.  For this is no normal day, and even in all the legends of ages past this will stand out as a day of reckoning.  Our civilisation in under peril, our way of life threatened from the orcish scourge.  We rest upon a knife edge, the world balancing on a pivot, and the wrong sway could tip us into darkness and despair forever.  Our actions today will decide this.  So yes, you have had a warning, you have had a message, and that message is to be strong.  For today we all hold the reins of fate in our palms, and only the steady hand can guide us past the threat of doom that is to come.  Neira, can you be that steady hand???
 
She looked at me with open and hopeful gaze, her fingers clenched around my wrist as if she sought to draw strength from me.  She nodded slowly then.  ?쏧?셫 sorry Aranion.  I just... I?셪l be strong.??
 
I turned to the others who all seemed rapt by my words.  It was clear that leaving them to their own thoughts could only bring trouble.  I had to pull them into action straight away.  ?쏧t begins now!??I shouted.  ?쏥ather your troops and prepare for the march.  Slow and steady we shall advance, carefully shall we hold the battle, and beyond fire and fury we will emerge free and victorious.  This day shall stand in history forever!  This day shall mark a new era for all the races!  The day of the Spellblaze is here!??

They all cheered and rushed to order their troops, taking courage from the duties of command.  Neira went to her own mages, and I left the pavilion alone.  But outside I was ambushed by Linaniil, who pulled me into an empty tent with a playful laugh.
 
?쏽e said ye were no leader!??she exclaimed with a grin.  ?쏷hat were a leader?셲 speech if ever I heard one.??

I shrugged and smiled modestly.  ?쏧 said what I had to.??
 
She drew close then, a sudden flush of worry in her face.  ?쏧t were just a dream, right??? I could see then beneath all the bravado and humour she was mortally scared, her fingers trembling as she gazed into my eyes, yearning for reassurance.
 
?쏧t was just a dream,??I lied, and it is a lie I have paid for with all my heart and soul.  ?쏣verything will be all right.?? I pulled her close and wrapped my arms around her slender frame, and she held tight to me, still trembling slightly.
 
?쏷hank you, Aranion,??she whispered.  Turning up her face she kissed me, and it was the softest, most delicate kiss she ever gave me.  It was also the last.
 
We parted then, and I began the lonely ride back to my own troops.  My heart was now pounding like a deafening war drum, whilst the words of Neira still echoed round my head.  They stirred up a memory in me of a dream I myself had that morning, but that had laid dormant in my mind till then.  I was lying in my bed, and floating above me was a shape of light and air, like the figure of a creature I had never seen before.  It had long tentacles for arms, and billowing robes fluttered about it slowly.  Where it should have a head there was only a small bump, but I could tell it was focused on me.  It stretched out a long tentacle towards me, as if it were warding against a dark and dangerous threat.  A feeling came over me of terrible foreboding, the looming portent of a doom like no other the world had ever seen.  As the tip of the tentacle neared my brow everything went black.

Was it a dream?  Some strange foretelling?  Or could it have been a true apparition, something trying to give me a direct warning?  But I had no time for such thoughts.  The time of the Spellblaze was nearly upon us, and there could be no room for doubt.  I spurred my horse on to my fate.]],

I loosened Mooncutter in its sheath as the troops marched forwards.  My grip tightened on the reins, holding my horse in check lest it gallop ahead in the excitement, and I could see my squire to my left doing the same.  The tension in the air was palpable.  Before us, less than a mile away, the vanguard of the orcish armies was now visible.  We had stirred up their nest and they had responded in full force.  They were like a shadowy blight that swallowed up the horizon, a great pestilence that threatened to consume the world.  Before me the armies of the Shaloren seemed small in comparison, but I knew our strength was not told by mere numbers.

Trumpets blared from the bulwarks at the front, as they readied to engage with the first wave when needed.  To the north were archers to crumble the initial resistance, and at their flank a legion of spellriders, their hands glowing with arcane energies as they sat atop their fearsome steeds.  On the south was the regular cavalry, the greatswords, the armoured knights and the main bulk of our mages, readying support spells.  Here and there senior battlemages were dotted about, ready to move swiftly to points of intense activity and blast it away.  There was no need to have more than one of them in any place - alone they could decimate a score of orcs with ease.

Drums beat loudly in the distance, and a clamour arose from the enemy.  They had with them trained beasts and trolls, and were arrayed in swords and maces and crude armours.  One took up a loud howl and others joined in, and the air seemed to reverberate with their ugly voices.

The cacophony was unsettling, but my army responded with a display of power.  Swords and speartips rose into the air, and crackles of lightning shot up to the heavens, the sparks shining off the gleaming blades and armour.  The orcish army gasped in dismay.  The eastern skyline was beginning to glow red, and we knew the dawn would break any moment now, the signal for the start of the Great Spellblaze.

?쏷he day is here!??one of our warriors shouted out, and it was taken up elsewhere by the marching troops.  ?쏷he day is here!??they began to chant, anticipating the glory to come.  ?쏷he day is here!??my squire sang, his voice full of youthful joy and hope.  ?쏷he day is here!??we all shouted in unison, the pride of the Shaloren kingdom in our hearts as we watched the first rays of sunlight shine out from the horizon.  ?쏷he day is here!  The day is here!  The day is-??

Silence.  All at once our voices dropped, and a terrible brooding silence swept over the battlefield.  We could feel it, every one of us, so attuned are our race to the flows of magic.  It was like having the breath sucked from one?셲 lungs, or the earth disappear from beneath one?셲 feet.  All our mana channels were gone, changed suddenly, arcane energies beyond all reach.  Groans and murmurs began to arise, as mages clutched at their heads in sudden despair.  I saw my squire lurch forwards in his saddle and begin to vomit uncontrollably, my standard slipping from his hand, whilst others fell to the ground in pain.  I struggled to battle an overwhelming migraine, blotches appearing in front of my eyes, and with great effort of will I managed to keep control of myself and began to seek out new paths of mana.

But there was something wrong, terribly wrong.  Like a river run off its course the flow of magic across the whole of Eyal had changed.  What could have caused this?  And now I had to fight years of attunement and training that had taught me to naturally rely on the known flows and courses so that I might find new paths, new sources.  And as I did so I put my powers into divination, and what I discovered shocked me to my core.

The orcs saw us in disarray and began to charge.  But my attention was turned west, not east, towards Elvala and the Crystal Tower where our leaders had been manipulating the Sher?셏ul farportal.  But the tower, I felt, was gone - crumpled into the earth, and from there now emanated a wave of white-hot flame.  The orcs tore into our army with little resistance, their weapons tearing through the elven troops, but they were soon met by a wave of destructive energy far greater.

?쏶hields!??I shouted out as the whole sky turned redder than blood, but above the sudden deafening roar of roasting air I was not heard.  It would have helped little anyway, defenceless as my army was without their usual sources of mana.  Spears of flame streaked down on our heads, shearing through flesh and steel in an instant and sinking into the earth.  The ground shook, and lava blasted up from the deep holes torn into the rock.

I put an arcane shield about myself with a great effort of will.  I saw my squire raise a hand to do the same, but a blaze tore off his arm.  He didn?셳 even get to scream before another wave burned through the top half of his torso.  Spurting blood evaporated instantly, and the air became full of red mist and fire.  I leapt from my horse as it neighed and stumbled and fell burning into ash.

Another wave came, and I tried to strengthen my shield, but the force of it took me off my feet and sent me flying.  I was thrashed through the air like a swirling leaf, unable to do anything more than struggle to maintain my protection.  All about my army was being utterly decimated, ranks and ranks of soldiers and mages burnt to a crisp or torn apart by the raw energies.  The orcs were the same, and a huge rent in the ground swallowed great numbers of their troops.  Blasts of lava soon thundered upward and rained down for miles around, turning into glowing rivers of death that swept across the consumed landscape.

How I managed to stay alive I am still not sure.  I almost slipped from consciousness at several points, but by a mental tenacity I never knew I had I managed to stay focused and keep my protective shield active.  I became less aware of my surroundings, not knowing if the bubble of my ward was floating through air or fire or blood, or swallowed into the depths of Eyal into some hell never before witnessed.  At last, after what seemed like a tortuous age, the wave of energy passed, and I found myself lying alone on an outcrop of cracked and parched earth, the air a haze of heat about me.

I struggled to my feet and looked around, seeing nothing but desolation in all directions.  Steam and smoke rose from rents in the ground, and blood, limbs and ashes were strewn about all over.  Nothing was alive.  In a daze I despaired that I was alone of the hundreds of thousands who had stood here but a short while before.  Friends and comrades, mentors and students, people I had never known and ones I was dearly close to - all gone.  A sudden pain lanced my heart as I thought of Linaniil.  She could not be dead, surely?

I gritted my teeth and summoned the energy to levitate, and as I rose I began to get my bearings around the changed landscape.  Slowly I pushed north-east, passing over devastation beyond belief.  I struggled to keep a grip on my sanity as the scent of burnt flesh and blood surrounded me, my vision filled with a horrored landscape beyond imagination, the utter silence more deafening than any sound I had ever heard.  Eventually I came near to where the Kar?셁rul army had stood, and cast about the ruined land for some sign of life.  Then faintly I detected something, some small sliver of life, and searching it out I found her.

Her clothes had been mostly burned off, her hair half turned to ash, and blood was seeping freely from burns all across her body.  A weak shield still hummed over her, but as I knelt down and laid a hand on her it vanished.  Quietly she gasped a breath before whispering, ?쏯eira?? and sinking into unconsciousness.  She was still alive, but barely.  I looked about and saw no signs of her sister, or of any of the rest of her troops, other than the scorched flesh and blackened bones that marked the scourging path swept by the blaze.

I began to cast what healing spells I could on Linaniil, but I could tell it was not enough, and my weakened powers could not hope to save her.  I began to cry openly, thinking of all I had lost this day, all that had gone so terribly wrong.  Hope had turned to crisis, and the cruelty of fate was far too much for me to bear.  Cradling my dying love?셲 head in my lap I turned my face to the sky and screamed.  Torment was in my cracked voice, and I raged against all the injustice of life and the futility of war, surrounded on all sides by blood and bones and ashes.  They had once been souls and lives with hopes and dreams, now all cast away like dust in the wind, and I lamented their deaths and my despair.

But mine was just one voice, one torment, a single note in the great cacophony that spread across the continent.  Millions of lives lost and shattered, millions of voices raised in anguish and torture and suffering, as the devastation continued over all Maj?섷yal from the ultimate force of destruction, the Spellblaze.]],

Perhaps what happened will never be truly understood.  What Sher?셏ul ruins survived the Spellblaze have been little touched since - the burned hand learns its lesson.  But we know that Ephinias and his mages lost control somehow, whatever delicacy and balance they wrought with coming untangled.  At the moment they tried to connect to the other farportals the imbalance was reverberated, resonated, magnified beyond control.  The farportal in the Crystal Tower imploded in a fraction of a second, killing all within and crushing the land about.  The energies in the Sher?셏ul relics then erupted in a blaze of white light, turning the air to fire and the ground to ruin.  The blaze swept eastwards, rolling over our battle with an unstoppable destructive force, and then carrying on towards the Thaloren lands.  Most of the ancient forests of Shatur were ripped from their roots, and the lands lain cursed ever since.

Meanwhile the other farportals all over Maj?섷yal erupted, white stone cracking and vast swathes of energy spilling forth.  All of the Cornac lands to the west were turned to desert, the dwarven halls of Korhek crumpled, the midvale plains were risen up as mountains and Lake Nur formed in their wake.  In the south the ancient tower of Darafel was collapsed, and the forests beside it morphed into an ever-broiling scar of lava and blackened earth.  Far in the east the Naloren farportal, the largest of all in Maj?섷yal, disappeared in a vast earthquake that swallowed everything for miles around, and boiling water spewed up to fill its cavernous depths.

And whilst this destruction was wrought the incredible energies disrupted all of the mana flow around Eyal.  Streams of energy that followed set, slowly changing courses, now were flooded and droughted, warped and split.  The threads of the elements were in vast disarray, and any attuned to magic suddenly found themselves far away from their accustomed power sources.

Even the Heavens were changed.  The wandering star of Vor disappeared, the constellations were tilted off their normal course, and the seasons rent harsher since.  Some say the moons dimmed and the sun went whiter after that day.  I do not know.  The whole world has seemed darker to me.

The numbers killed are beyond count.  The initial destruction took at least five million lives, and the terror that followed claimed far more.  For though it had been a day of tragedy and immeasurable woe, it was to be followed by a bloody age of darkness and torment.

But none of this I knew as I lay weeping in the aftermath, cradling in my lap the one life I cared about.  In abject misery I called on all the healing powers I could to bring her back to me for but one moment.  Her heart beat softly, and her eyes opened, but seemed glassy and far away.

?쏬inaniil,??I whispered, and her dark eyes turned towards my face.  I tried to mumble an apology, to say I was sorry and was unable to help her, but emotions overcame my voice.  Her gaze at me was empty, as if she looked right through me, before she turned her eyes away.  Slowly she raised a hand to an amulet about her neck, and with a light touch it glowed and then cracked.  Her eyes closed again but I could feel the power from the artifact pumping into her, strengthening her heart-beat and mending her flesh.  She was unconscious and still badly wounded, but for now the mortal threat was gone.

My thoughts were mixed - glad she was no longer at death?셲 door, but worried she might relapse, and at the back of my mind scared of that empty look she had given me.  Could she possibly forgive my part in this?

Carefully I picked up her frail body, and began the journey back to Elvala.  Two days it took on foot, through blasted and ruined ground.  On the passage I came across other survivors, refugees now leaving their destroyed homes, heading to the city to seek shelter.  I tried to nurse Linaniil as best I could, giving her water during brief periods of waking and dressing her wounds, but true healing could not happen till I reached the city.

Elvala was a quiet chaos, oppressed by fear and uncertainty, an air of dread filling all the streets.  The news had broken that our army had been entirely wiped out - there would be no loved ones returning to their families, and the sound of stifled mourning was to be heard in all corners of the city.

I took Linaniil straight to the healing grounds in the palace and gave her to the doctors with the strictest instructions.  They were swamped by casualties, but followed my orders without question, tending immediately to her wounds and applying tinctures and regenerative spells.

It was as I watched over her quietly that a party bustled loudly into the grounds.  I recognised at their head was Perissa, a senior court official.  At her side was an elderly human who immediately went to where Linaniil lay.

?쏥eneral Aranion!??announced Perissa loudly, ?쏧 heard you were here, but I could scarce believe it.  Thank the threads you have returned to us!  This is a grave time; we must talk at once.??

But I ignored her as I saw the human touch Linaniil?셲 hand, and her eyes gently open.  ?쏞uilan???she murmured softly.

?쏛ye, it is me, my lady,??he said quietly.  ?쏧 have been sent here by your father.  He has ordered me to pass you this.?? And with that he brought forth a golden ring set with a fiery ruby.  I recognised it immediately as the Ring of Kar?셁rul, worn by the mighty Turthel.  Linaniil sat up quickly, wincing from the pain, but with her eyes locked on the ring as it was placed in her hand.

?쏝ut mine father...??

?쏧?셫 sorry, my lady.  It brings me great sorrow to bear you this news.  Your father and his court are dead.  His last act was to instruct me to bring this ring to you and your sister.  Neira...??he said glancing about.  ?쏧s she...??? He saw the look in Linaniil?셲 eyes and dipped his head despondently.  ?쏧 see.  I am terribly sorry.  It becomes my duty then, my lady, to declare you the new leader of the Kar?셁rul.??

?쏥eneral Aranion,??interjected Perissa.  ?쏧 really must speak with you now!??

?쏻ait!??I barked, and turned to the human Cuilan.  ?쏻hat is happening here?  How could one such as Turthel be killed???

The man looked at me then with a wan sadness in his eyes, before turning to address Linaniil.  ?쏽esterday, the day after the terrible Spellblaze, as we began some attempt at reconstruction, still struggling to realign our mana paths, a murmur began amongst the people.  It spoke thus: The Kar?셁rul circle of mages had betrayed the ordinary people.  They accused us of siding with the elves to destroy non-mages, of toying with terrible powers beyond our control, of deliberately massacring them out of evil and malice.  We could not logic with them, they would listen to no reason, and they rose up in violent anger.  They attacked many of us, with farming instruments and whatever weapons they could find.  Our defences were weak, and striking back just made the crowd fiercer.  We retreated to your father?셲 home, begging for help, but he shook his head and said he could not fight back.  They came for us then, storming his palace, and Turthel ordered all to put up no resistance.  He handed me his ring, saying to seek you out in Elvala, and then stepped outside to face the crowds.  He didn?셳 resist!  The people... they... they...?? He lapsed into sullen silence, shaking his head in sorrow.  He looked like he wanted to cry, but had no tears left to shed.  Linaniil?셲 face was graven and she stared hard at the ring.

Perissa grabbed me then and turned me to her attention.  ?쏷his is what I need to speak with you about, General Aranion.  If this human?셲 tale is to be believed then we are in very grave danger!  Scout reports suggest there is a body of humans coming here from the north as we speak.  From what this human says they seek retribution - they wish to slaughter us all.  A storm of wrath lies on our borders and we are defenseless!  We need you desperately to organise our defence, to protect our city and our people.??

I felt numb, the events overwhelming me.  ?쏝ut who leads us???I said.

?쏷here is no one.  What royals are known to be alive are not suited.  We are entering a time of war, a terrible time like no other we have ever faced.  We need military leadership.  You, General Aranion, you must be our leader.??

I held Perissa?셲 gaze then and saw the wisdom in her words.  My duty as a Shaloren was clear.  But my heart tremored as I turned to look at Linaniil.

?쏷his be our path then, Aranion,??she said quietly, raising herself from the bed and carefully placing the ring on the middle finger of her right hand.  ?쏧 must tend to mine people, and ye to yours.  We will not meet again.??

?쏝ut your wounds-??I tried to object.

?쏻ill never heal!??she cried, hate dripping from her voice.  Her eyes were like cold and impenetrable ice, a smouldering anger deep within.  ?쏞ome, Cuilan, we must leave this place.?? And with that they departed, Linaniil walking tall and proud in spite of her injuries.

I closed off my heart and my emotions then, lest they overwhelm me.  My duty was before me, and the events of the past had to be locked away from memory.

The ceremony was organised in under an hour, and I was anointed leader of the Grand Council of Elvala, head of the Shaloren people.  On my order rangers began transporting in survivors from outpost settlements, whilst I commanded our remaining mages to begin a new endeavour around our city walls.

The first waves of the storm of hate came the next day.  Human peasants and farmers, ordinary workers armed poorly, their looted swords and spears badly wielded.  I stood alone at our gates as they approached, Mooncutter in my hand.  When the first few charged at me I thrust the blade into the soil and tore a great chasm in the earth, and our mages summoned forth mists and smoke that rose from the ground and began to surround our whole city.  As the peasants stumbled in confusion archers started firing from our walls.  What few made it through the smoke and arrows I took on, tearing Mooncutter through their flesh with little resistance.  Their blood gushed out in the gallons, drenching our ground, staining my skin.  It was like a warm shower over my boiling emotions, a bath of blood to wash over my sins.

The Shroud of Elvala was begun, as our whole city was wreathed in cloud and smoke.  Our shield, our mask, our hiding.  It would last for centuries, the only dealings with the outside world being in furtive secrecy.

We veiled our guilt, cloaked our crimes.  Though we had some communication with the outside through halfling traders and the odd disguised Shaloren adventurer, we remained mute to the world at large, hidden from their accusing gaze.  Outside our quiet walls others had not the luxury of hiding.  The Spellhunt was begun, and it knew no mercy.

Ordinary people rose up against what they perceived as the arrogance of the mages, a revolt against the power of the few that had ruined the lives of so many.  Any suspected of sorcery or ties to the Art were cruelly dealt with.  There was sympathy for none, and many innocents fell victim to the unquenchable thirst for retribution.  The madness swept across the whole of Maj?섷yal.

Law and order had broken down.  Armies, territories and whole cities had been destroyed or ravaged by the Spellblaze, with many areas left completely uninhabitable.  Kingdoms fell and tyrants arose.  Bandits picked at the bones of civilisation like vultures on a rotten corpse.

An organisation called the Ziguranth, thought dead long ago, came into resurgence, gaining popular support from the people in their anti-magic crusade.  We heard of some mages going into hiding, but inevitably being rooted out, or fleeing desperately from place to place.  Dark tales also arose of necromancers and fell wizards creating dungeons and strongholds, fending off or evading attacks, and beginning reigns of terror.

And one tale came to my ears of a group of mages that managed to band together and stay in hiding, though always on the run from the chasing Ziguranth.  The story from outside was that they were led by a demon with fiery hair, fiercely glowing eyes and hands wrapped in flames, that fought with blazing wrath and could be opposed by none.  I knew that description well...

I carried out my reign, my duty, taking care of the Shaloren people.  We were safe from attackers, secure in our supplies through discrete trade, and slowly building back some of what we had lost.  But both fear and shame prevented us from showing our face to the world.

Fifteen long years passed before I awoke one night in my council chambers, the crescent Wintertide moon softly illuminating a shape near the end of my bed.  The figure was tall and slim, wrapped in tight-fitting wools and furs.  Her crimson hair stirred gently as she stood with her back to me.  Memories arose of a night long ago, in a more innocent time, when a younger me and a younger her first became close.

I barely dared to whisper her name, afraid that she might disappear, an apparition or a dream that could be broken by a spoken word.  ?쏬inaniil,??I softly mouthed.  She turned to me, and I saw those same dark eyes I remembered.  But they were surrounded by lines of care, the markings of years of strain and responsibility clear on her face.

Rising from my bed I gathered a robe about me.  I took a few steps towards her but stopped, not able to move myself any further.  I wanted to be near her, to put my arms around her, but it felt as if she were across a wide chasm from me, a gulf of time and pain between us.

?쏧 have come for help, Aranion,??she said in a low voice, not quite meeting my gaze.  ?쏷here be something I seek, and ye must aid me in achieving it.?? I did not understand, but I nodded my assent.  ?쏥et ye dressed and ready then.  There be a long journey ahead of us.??

She stepped towards the window, her back towards me again, waiting as I put on a stralite mail and gathered my sword.  When she noticed I was ready she levitated out, and I followed.

We whistled through the air, travelling northwards at great speed.  The lands swept beneath us, and the climate grew colder as we went further and further north.  Hours passed in intrepid silence, till we were flying above snowy tundra.  We soared past plains of white and grey before we reached a low range of hills.  Here Linaniil slowed and descended, and I went down beside her.  We came to rest before a dark opening at the foot of the hills.

Linaniil stood for a while staring at the black cave.  Fear radiated from her face, but her eyes were hard and determined.  ?쏧t is here,??she said quietly, her voice steady.  I followed her gaze, trying to guess what secrets this remote place contained, but I could sense nothing special.

She marched forwards and I followed, until we came right up to the shadowed opening.  Linaniil hesitated a moment, staring into the blackness, before finally stepping inside and being swallowed from sight.  I could feel it then, the sensation that something ancient lay in this place.  My skin tingled and my arcane attunement felt on fire.  This dark cave held some mysterious force, secluded from all knowledge since the oldest days of Eyal.  There was something here that could change the destiny of the world.

I took a deep breath and stepped forwards.]],

Light sprung from Linaniil?셲 staff, and she cast about a luminescence, revealing a narrow icy passageway that led downwards.  It was deathly cold, and our breaths condensed in clouds as we made our way down the wending tunnels.  My skin pricked, and all my senses seemed on edge.

?쏻hat is down here???I asked, my curiosity all-consuming.

?쏱ower,??Linaniil responded, not looking at me as she spake, continuing to follow the path.  ?쏛nd power be what I seek.  I am afeared for mine people, but have not the strength to protect them as I wouldst like.  With what be here, perhaps, I shall have the power to make a safe haven.  This be a place of legend amongst mine people, and I have scouted it out over many years.  Today I shall finally reach what lies at the centre.??

?쏛nd why do you need me???

She didn?셳 respond, but carried onwards.  We reached a split in the tunnel, and without hesitation Linaniil took the left path.  It led further and further underground.  We came to blockages, but by arcane force the sorceress easily cleared a way.

As we passed through a large cavern I sensed movement, and drew Mooncutter quickly.  What looked like a disembodied limb, or some great thrashing worm, was writhing towards us pathetically.  Linaniil send a blast of fire towards it - it squealed and went still.

And then more movement, a hundred movements.  From crevasses and holes in the walls and ceiling there burst out dozens upon dozens of the worm-like creatures, their maggoty bodies flapping rigorously, fanged mouths opening up and screaming torturous sounds.  Linaniil growled and began sending torrents of flame towards the approaching horde.  I covered her back, slicing open their pale green flesh and sending strokes of lightning through their ranks.  In under a minute we had dispatched them all.

I prodded a corpse with my foot and it collapsed into sludge.  ?쏻hat strange creatures,??I commented.  I looked at Linaniil for some explanation but she simply proceeded forward.  I followed after, keeping my sword in hand and watching closely for further attacks.

At the other end of the cavern a wall of ice blocked our way.  Linaniil held up the Ring of Kar?셁rul, and the jewel on it began to blaze.  The ice melted away slowly, revealing a passage to another, smaller chamber.

This cold, crypt-like hollow was covered in smooth, glistening ice on all sides.  The walls were square and straight, and ancient pillars of marble were dotted about the room.  On the pillars and walls were weathered runes and symbols.  I came close to study some, but couldn?셳 recognise them from any of my studies.  ?쏻hat was this place???I asked, turning to Linaniil.  ?쏧t seems older even than Sher?셏ul.??

She ran her hand over one of the walls, tracing the outline of a door.  ?쏧t be a temple to Quekorja, god of a race called the Weissi.  The were killed off by the Sher?셏ul long before our races were born.  They did build this temple in honour of Quekorja, and the last of them did die here defending her.??

I looked about in awe.  Though I had explored many Sher?셏ul ruins I hadn?셳 seen anything like this.  The architecture was simple but elegant.  There was a crude beauty to it all.  I turned back to the door Linaniil was examining.

She was trying to open it, but was obviously struggling to find a way.  ?쏷here be some key, some puzzle to open this,??she muttered.  ?쏝ut I can nay solve it - the secret be lost to time.?? She growled in anger and stood back.  Holding out her staff she unleashed a blast of arcane force from it, violently splitting the stone door apart and tearing open a passage to a chamber beyond.

Many things suddenly happened at once.  From beyond I felt a pulse of energy, a huge surge of power that I had never felt before.  Linaniil was focussed on it intensely.  But noise came from all around of creatures moving asudden.  From the cave we had entered from there was a shriek of a hundred wailing voices, and the floor beneath our feet trembled.  Rocks fell from the ceiling and out burst horrific creatures with spiked limbs and smooth, triangular faces.  From the trembling ground arose a strange ethereal being of light, with long tentacles for limbs.  And as I turned to face these threats I saw that in the previous cavern the worms had come back to life, and were now coalescing into a huge mass of putrid flesh.

I tried to cut through the being of light, but my sword barely slowed as it passed through it, and the flames I summoned seemed to have little effect.  It raised a tentacle towards me and an intensely bright beam of light shone from it through my torso, filling my flesh with searing pain.  I jumped back and send a wave of ice at it, tearing off a tentacle and pushing it further away.  Meanwhile Linaniil had reduced one of the spiked creatures to a pile of ash, but her arcane shield was collapsing beneath the slashes of the others, and more were spilling from the ceiling.  In the entranceway the mass of worms was pressing through, and from the mouths of the flailing bodies came spits of burning acid.

We were at severe risk of getting surrounded in this confined space, the numbers too many to take on at once.  ?쏰ver here!??shouted Linaniil, as she dashed through the door she had split apart.  I followed, slashing my blade through the mass of worms, causing it to lurch back screeching in pain, and spearing a blast of lightning through one of the spiked creatures, splitting open its head.  It continued to attack me, but I parried and cut its arm off, dancing around it and reaching the doorway.  With my back to the opening I brought up a wall of water and sent it flooding into the chamber, pushing the horrors away as I leapt backwards through the door.

As soon as I passed through Linaniil thrust her staff into the ground and a pillar of rock rose upwards, sealing off the opening.  I could hear thrashing and thumping sounds from the other side, but for now we seemed safe.  ?쏻hat were those things?!??I asked incredulously, as I scanned around the open cavern for signs of any more creatures.  It was a large space, but everything was still, and I could see no other entrances.

?쏶cions of Amakthel,??she responded calmly.  ?쏷he butchered god seeks to break his chains.  But he needs more power...  And here in this dark, forgotten place is part of that power he seeks.??

?쏛nd what is here?  What terrible power lies here that would draw both you and those horrors?!??

?쏲uekorja,??she said.

?쏲uekorja?  The... the god??? I couldn?셳 believe I what I was hearing.  ?쏻as it not slain by the Sher?셏ul???

?쏛ye, that it were.  But there be power even in a slain god.  Look behind ye, Aranion.??

I turned then, wondering what she wanted me to behold.  It took me a moment to see it, but when I did I gasped in shock.  The far wall of this great cavern was not merely a wall.  It was covered in a thick layer of ice, but beneath at its centre I could make out a huge yellow eye.  And around that eye I could trace out a giant form.  Dark grey skin covered a bulging head, topped with three great curved horns, which sat atop a long, thick body with six limbs.  It was deathly still and chillingly ancient, seeming more like part of the rock than anything that had once been alive.  I couldn?셳 believe what I was seeing, but I could feel it.  In that corpse was still power, immense power, like nothing I had ever felt before.

?쏷his be it,??said Linaniil.  ?쏰ne of the few corpses of the gods left to find in Maj?섷yal.  And I shall take its power as mine own.??

?쏷his is insane!??I shouted.  ?쏽ou have no idea if that is safe or not.  You don?셳 know what it will do to you!??

She chuckled darkly.  ?쏛ye, that be true.  But that is why I have brought ye here.?? I looked at her in confusion and she chuckled again.  ?쏽e still know not your purpose here.  Did ye think I took ye here for protection?  That I couldst not handle those horrors on mine own?  No, there be a different reason I have brought ye.  When I absorb this corpse, when I take its power for mine own, I do not know what wilst become of me.  It may kill me.  Or it may drive me mad, it may turn me into something terrible.  Should that happen, Aranion, you art the only one I know with the strength to kill me.??

The words hit me like a blow to the chest.  ?쏫ill you?  But I couldn?셳...??

?쏝ut ye must!??she said firmly.  ?쏛fter all ye have done... all the torture ye have brought my life... ye owe me this.?? I looked deep into her eyes and saw the turmoil of emotions within, the pain and agony of all that had befallen her, the hatred and blame of those who had wronged her, the guilt and shame for not being able to do more herself.  And deep inside still some touch of love for me and what we had shared.  I reached out my hand and stroked her soft hair, my fingers touching lightly against the side of her face.  I leaned in close and she closed her eyes, turning her face up to me as I moved my lips towards hers.

?쏯o!??she suddenly cried, pushing me back.  ?쏧t cannot be!?? She swiftly turned from me, and I saw a tear drip down one cheek.  ?쏷he world has changed, Aranion.  I have a duty before me, and none can walk that path beside me.?? And with that she began to run, staff in hand, towards the great eye whose dead gaze was locked behind the wall of ice.  I sprinted after her, but she was faster, and with running leap she thrust the base of her staff through the ice and into the center of the god?셲 eye.

The ice cracked with a deafening thunder, and the giant yellow eye pulsed before exploding in a ball of light.  I stopped and covered my eyes as white light flooded the room and shards of ice flew through the air.  I could barely make out Linaniil, bathed in light, hanging with one hand from her staff, her hair and robes blown backwards as she reached forwards with her other arm.  Slowly, intrepidly, she placed her hand into the centre of the ball of light where the eye had been, and shadows danced about the cavern as she wrapped her fingers round that luminous sphere, before squeezing tight.

The cavern shook, her staff shattered, the wall creaked and split before wholly blasting apart.  The corpse of the dead god collapsed into a stream of silver and in a roaring cacophony rushed towards Linaniil, tearing apart her robes and sinking into her skin.  She floated in the air, limbs outstretched as the vast energy poured into her flesh.  She opened her mouth as if to scream and light burst out, and light spilled from her eyes and ears.  The cavern quaked dangerously and rocks fell from the walls and ceiling.  But in seconds it was over, the corpse of the god fully absorbed, the light in Linaniil?셲 eyes went out, and she dropped to the ground like a stone.

Then the horrors broke through, the collapsing cavern having made an opening for them, and immediately they sped hungrily to where Linaniil lay.  ?쏯o!??I cried, rushing to intercept them.  ?쏽ou cannot have her!??

I sliced off the head of a spiked creature and put up a wall of fire ahead of the rest of them as I backed towards Linaniil?셲 body.  She looked dead, with no sign of movement or breathing, but I had no time to check.  The being of light and tentacles passed through my flames without resistance, and I ran sparks along my sword as I tore it up the centre of the monster.  It shot light through my torso and I coughed up blood, but I forced my sword in deeper and ran a flood of arcane energy through it, blowing the thing apart.  More spiked creatures came, and I took care of my footing whilst parrying and chopping on my left and sending waves of flame to my right.

The mass of worms broke through the wall, and with it two more luminous horrors, and some fiend of darkness and nightmares, and I could see behind others were spilling through.  I put up a shield as rays of light shot towards me, and sent balls of frost back at them.  One of the light beings fell, whilst the other was slowed.  The dark thing came quickly, and the mass of worms not far behind, so I sliced my sword across the ground, sending heat through it, and turned the stone into a mass of lava.  The dark thing came around it, and I felt an aura of deathly cold from it as it approached.  I hacked at it desperately, and it shot back speared limbs towards my chest that seemed to suck all strength from me.  With a roar I shot a pulse of flames down my blade and it burst apart.  The worms charged directly over the lava, squealing in pain as a bulk of them were burned, but coming at me with speed.  I adjusted my grip, getting ready to make deft strokes to stay out of its range, but a lance of light then shot through my leg, dropping me to one knee with a scream.  The mass of worms rushed at me then, and I dug my sword deep into their midst, but the worms crawled over my arms, digging their acidic teeth into my flesh and reaching for my neck.  With my left arm I cast a blanket of flames over them, burning my arm along with the screeching worms.  They pulled away slightly, but the being of light was approaching from the side, a tentacle flaring up in luminescent energy, and three spiked horrors were behind it.  My right arm was burnt, my left leg injured, my mail pocked with holes, and my mana reserves were running low.  But I gritted my teeth in determination - I could not back from this fight.  I rushed at the mass of worms with my sword held firm.

It exploded in a fiery mess, and an intense wave of force and fire blasted across the cavern, turning the other horrors to ash, and even burning through the luminous being - a low scream arising from it as the flames tore it apart.  I gasped, not knowing whence this blaze had come, until I turned around and saw Linaniil.  She was standing tall, her robes burnt off, flames dancing up and down her skin, bright light shining from her eyes.  Heat seemed to radiate from her.  I kept my grip on my sword, not sure if this was the Linaniil I knew, or some other force born of her union with the dead god.

She laughed suddenly, and it was a harsh laugh that I had not heard her make before.  ?쏻hat a fool I have been,??she said, almost to herself.  ?쏧 brought ye here in case ye had to stop me.  But now...  Now mine power exceeds ye by a long distance.  Ye would have no hope of opposing me!?? She made a low sound somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.  ?쏛h, but ye have no cause to worry.  I am still me.  Mostly.  And through pain and sacrifice I have achieved the power I desired.  The power I need.??

I let my sword dip and breathed heavily, relief mingled with trepidation sweeping through me, whilst the withdrawing adrenalin of battle left me feeling exhausted.  I looked Linaniil over, her pale skin now glowing, her eyes brimming with energy and vitality.  I saw the power she had was not in mere force, but that she had taken on the ageless nature of the gods.  A power forbidden to all creatures was now hers and hers alone.

?쏻hat now???I said quietly.

?쏯ow, ye go home, and I go to make mine home, a sanctuary for me and mine people.??

?쏻ill we meet again???

She smiled sadly.  ?쏮ayhaps.  Mayhaps not.  The world changes quicker than predictions can tell.  But if we do meet again it shall be in a place that does not yet exist - the city of Angolwen.?? She raised an arm then and from it shot a tremendous pulse of arcane energy, the violet light shooting to the roof of the cavern and spearing through, deep through, till it split the rock apart right through to the open sky a mile above.  Sunlight spilled down, splashing over Linaniil?셲 lithe form.  It had been many hours since this long long night had begun.

?쏝ut for now, farewell Aranion,??she said as she began to float from the ground.  And then she sped up and soared out of sight.

I lay down on the cold stone, resting for a while, slowly healing my wounds and recovering my strength.  I reflected on the events since the evening before, thinking back on the trials of all the races of Maj?섷yal.  War, disease and death threatened all equally.  Was Linaniil beyond that now?  How would a taste of immortality affect her?

It was then that thought for our race came to me.  In ages past we had searched for immortality.  Our ancestral leaders had obsessed over it, but out of vanity, pride and a fear of death.  What would the real effects be if all our society were to be gifted with it?  With immortal life we might separate ourselves from the strifes and wars of the world.  It would give us a perspective beyond the petty squabbles and prideful competition of the other races.

I dug through the ice and rocks and found still some trace of the dead god Quekorja, faint though it were.  I gathered all that was left and made the long journey back to Elvala.  There I retreated to my labs, studying the remains for years before finally unlocking its secrets.  It was thus that immortality for our race was born, and it has changed our outlook on the world ever since.

We stood apart from the others then, not engaging in war, finding a new respect for life.  It was not till Garkul the Devourer assaulted our gates in the Age of Pyre that we ever had cause for large scale war again, and I rode out to face him in combat.

But ah, that is another tale, one indeed of many tales, in the long and rich history of the Tales of Maj?섷yal...]],
