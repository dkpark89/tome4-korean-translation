The only thing that you are sure of is that it has offered you a moment of rest from the long suffering of your cursed life.
You feel the hate inside you melt away. You feel as if the curse has subsided for a moment.

This place makes you wonder if there is a way to end the curse.
And if you can't overcome it you might be able to master it and take back a part of your life.
Either way, you feel the time has come to do something more about this curse.

You wake up (if you can call it that) in a vivid dream. A small trail winds through the dense forest.

Instead you feel the rising fear and hatred that rule your waking life. Further down the trail you hear voices.

* Mom apparently died like the others but they refuse to say much more about it. I think all of the bodies were burned.

* Terrik mentioned the caravan was having a good year. Profits were great and the usual bandits and thieves were absent. Something scaring them off?

* Some of the dead had 'normal' wounds but some were just 'lifeless' or 'pale'. Jak was found the same way. That was 2 months earlier.

* All of the attackers were spirits or wisps of darkess. As far as I can tell no one was spared attack, though a few survived. I'll need to check their stories.

* People keep mentioning the 3 new hires when I ask about this. Why do they come to mind? I hear Berethh is some kind of hero around these parts. Alva thought Kyless was a rotten person. She's not the only one.

* Someone said "Bander, you ask too many questions." I'll have to give them some time. Even after all these years.

It belonged to Bander's mom, and before that, his dad. You remember she never went anywhere without it.
Bander was just a kid then. You wonder how he's turned out. Not well you imagine. Thanks to Berethh, Kyless and you.
You keep turning the acorn in your hand and squeezing it until the cold iron bites into your skin.
That gives you comfort somehow. Unable to part with it, you put it in your pack.

This is the merchant caravan you once belonged to. You haven't thought of them for a long time, but now they haunt your dreams.

You suddenly realize how much you despise them now. Is it this hate that fuels your curse?
They wanted to kill you, but left you to die instead. They could feel what you had become.

As you lie there you notice yourself turning something around in your hand. It is the small acorn from the dream.
You open your hand and see that it has been stained with someone else's blood. You grip the acorn tighter until you can feel the pain of the biting iron.

Your hate is burning inside you again. If it has to be released then there is only one person who deserves it more than anyone.
He had a sanctuary: a cave where he would store his 'profits'. Perhaps you could find him there.

As you look around the meadow you realize what this place is and perhaps what drew you here.
Kyless had taken you this way once. On the north side of the meadow was a secret path that led to his cave.

There are signs of an old battle here. Two skeletons lie on the floor dressed in hand-crafted armor, their simple but well-made weapons still in hand.
The bodies don't look old enough to have decomposed but seem rather gnawed on. The remains of several large dogs also lie nearby.
Suddenly you catch movement in the corner. One of the dogs appears to be alive. It's lean and dirty and has an unnatural way of moving.
That's when you notice shadows move across the floor towards the dog. The animal lifts its head as if listening to something.
Together the dog and the shadows rise up to face you.

I finally made it out. I don't think I could stay another year on that farm.
Dad had no ambition. Every time I went with him to sell our crop he took whatever the merchants offered him.
When the job with the caravan came up, how could I not take it? I'm sure I'll be back to see the parents soon.
So far the work at the caravan is pretty dull. I've been paying attention to the merchants though.
They let me follow them on their trips into the towns. I'm learning a lot. In time I may become one of them.
The caravan hired a couple of other porters too. They won't say but I think the last ones were killed in some kind of raid.
I'll have to learn to defend myself or let others do it for me. Still, this is better than being a farmer.

Berethh found something in the woods...a dead man and a few dead trolls.
At first we thought they killed each other but there weren't any wounds we could see. It was something awful though; you could see it in their faces.
Berethh just wanted to leave. He didn't like the way it felt. But I just couldn't pass up a free opportunity like that.
They had some money on them and some other things which we divided up. The man also had a book, which I took.
I've been studying it. It seems like some kind of magic, but nothing like any of the magic I've heard in stories.
It's more like a language. A way of thinking or calling out with your mind. I'm learning it now.
I hear what sound like whispers in my head. And I've found I can whisper back.
My mind can reach out. Control things. Control people. But there's more. Something is out there. I have to reach out.
Once I've mastered this I may be able to use it to advance in the caravan. I'm tired of just being a porter.

I've come so far in the last year. The other merchants listen to me now. They think I have a real gift for trade.
The weak-minded peasants we trade with are so easy to control though. They practically give me their money.
But the real money and power rests with the bandits. Those two that ambushed me got what they deserved. So did the rest of their camp.
The fear on their faces when I struck was priceless. They must have had more gold than the caravan makes in a year!
I got some help carrying it off to a nearby cave. A few more encounters like that and I'll be rich.
Until then, I'll stay with the caravan. The only prolem is Jak. He doesn't trust me.
I guess I threaten his authority. Not sure what I'll have to do about that...

Berethh! He must have followed me back to the cave. How could he know I was behind the attacks?
And now he's betrayed me. We were friends once! It seems he's made some new friends in these parts.
I thought I could retreat back into the cave. Take them in the darkness like I always do.
But they didn't follow. He must have known I was too strong.
The entrance has been sealed now. I can't seem to break it. Nothing I've tried works.
It's as though the seal were alive, growing stronger with every attack. Berethh must have planned this carefully.
I'm sure I can overcome his wards though. I just need some time to grow my power.

It's one of the vaults that Kyless used to store the valuable things he recovered on his excursions.
For a cut you had helped him carry stuff down here. You made some pretty good money off him.
Funny how it seemed like such a fortune then. The loot of petty bandits.
You should have turned your back on him. Things got pretty bad toward the end.
You knew he was greedy and ambitious but you didn't realize how cold-hearted he was.
You never thought he would go after the caravan. How could you have known?
You've tried to forget that day for a long time. You've tried to forget what he did to those people.
And those things of his almost killed you too. But maybe you were cursed long before that day ever happened.
