They came across a group of elves, seemingly native to those lands, and befriended them - founding the Sunwall and the Gates of Morning.
Then the orc pride came and we have been fighting for our survival ever since.]],

Aside from a few early attempts with questionable results, he hasn't had much luck. Still, it's gladdening to hear that the volunteers for his experiments live, regardless of their location. We are all still under the same Sun, after all.

Actually... maybe it would benefit you if you meet Zemekkys. He would surely be intrigued by that Orb of Many Ways you possess. He lives in a small house just to the north.]],

Now they are dead? At the hands of just one @playerdescriptor.race@? Truly I am amazed by your power.
While you were busy bringing an end to the orcs, we managed to discover some parts of the truth from a captive orc.
He talked about the shield protecting the High Peak. It seems to be controlled by "orbs of command" which the masters of the Prides had in their possession.
Look for them if you have not yet found them.
He also said the only way to enter the peak and de-activate the shield is through the "slime tunnels", located somewhere in one of the Prides, probably Grushnak.

But I might be able to help you by explaining how the Pride is organised.
Recently we have heard the Pride speaking about a new master, or masters. They might be the ones behind that mysterious staff of yours.
We believe that the heart of their power is the High Peak, in the center of the continent. But it is inaccessible and covered by some kind of shield.
You must investigate the bastions of the Pride. Perhaps you will find more information about the High Peak, and any orc you kill is one less that will attack us.
The known bastions of the Pride are:
- Rak'shor Pride, in the west of the southern desert
- Gorbat Pride, in a mountain range in the southern desert
- Vor Pride, in the northeast
- Grushnak Pride, on the eastern slope of the High Peak]],
