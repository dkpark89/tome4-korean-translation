Well met, @playername@!
I am Meranas, Herald of Angolwen. I have come here at the request of King Tolak, who worried when you didn't return.
We have been watching Tannen for some time, and were pleased to see you reveal his true nature-- and stop him. For this we are grateful, and I think we can pay you back.
We have studied his portal research, and if you give me the components I will create the portal for you, here and now!]],
