You see great fortresses like this one, flying all over the skies of Eyal - shining bastions of power glittering in the young sun.
You see the gods beaten, defeated and dead. All but one.
Then you see darkness; it seems like the shadow does not know what followed those events.

You shake your head as the vision dissipates, and your normal sight comes back slowly.

Take this Transmogrification Chest. It is linked by a permanent farportal to the Fortress. Any item you put inside will be sent to the power core and dismantled for energy.
There are, however, unwanted byproducts to this operation: the generation of a metal known as gold. It is of no use to the Fortress and thus will be sent back to you.]],

Beware that the return portal may not be nearby your arrival point; you will need to find it. You can use the rod of recall to try to force an emergency recall, but it has high chances of breaking the exploratory farportal forever.
You may use the farportal; however, beware - I sense a strange presence in the farportal room.]],
