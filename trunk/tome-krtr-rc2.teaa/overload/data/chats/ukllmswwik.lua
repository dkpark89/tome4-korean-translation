During the Age of Pyre the world was sundered by the last effects of the Spellblaze. A part of the continental shelf of Maj'Eyal was torn apart and thrown into the sea.
The Naloren Elves perished... or so the world thinks. Some of them survived; using ancient Sher'Tul magic they had kept for themselves, they transformed to live underwater.
They are now called the nagas. They live deep in the ocean between Maj'Eyal and the Far East.
One of them, Slasul, rebelled against his order and decided he wanted the world for himself, both underwater and above. He found an ancient temple, probably a Sher'Tul remain, called the Temple of Creation.
He believes he can use it to #{italic}#improve#{normal}# nagas.
But he has become mad and now looks upon all other intelligent water life as a threat, and that includes myself.
I cannot leave this sanctuary, but perhaps you could help me?
After all, it would be an act of mercy to end his madness.]],
