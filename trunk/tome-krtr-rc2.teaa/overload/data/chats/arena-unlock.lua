Yes...yes...you look like a promising warrior indeed...
I have an offer, @playerdescriptor.race@.
You see...I am an agent for the Arena. I look for promising warriors that
can provide a good show for our audience. Perhaps you are strong enough to join.
All you need to do is beat three of my men in battle, and you shall be rewarded.
#LIGHT_GREEN#*You consider the offer of the mysterious hooded man for a moment*

The Arena is where the brave come to fight against all odds.
We are still growing up, and we lack challengers...
It's like a gamble, but you use your fighting instead of money to play, you see?
We in the Arena work hard to make a good show, and in return...you can get enough
wealth and glory to last for centuries!
If you can pass my little test...I will #LIGHT_RED#allow you to join the Arena when
you are done with your adventures.#WHITE#
You also shall gather some much needed #LIGHT_RED#combat experience#WHITE# from fighting
our men...so, what do you think? Are you up to it?

That's unfortunate. We could have used someone like you.
You are just the type the audience likes. You could have been a champion.
Alas, if you stand by your choice, we shall never meet again.
However, if you change your mind...I will #YELLOW#stay on Derth just a little
longer.#WHITE#
If I am still around, we can have a deal. Think about it, @playerdescriptor.race@.

Well done, @playerdescriptor.race@! I knew you had potential.

The name's Rej. I work for the arena to recruit great fighters who can give a
good show... and not die in two blows. You are one of those, indeed!
I won't keep you away from your adventures. I was there too, long ago.
But we can make you a true champion, beloved by many and bathing in diamonds.
