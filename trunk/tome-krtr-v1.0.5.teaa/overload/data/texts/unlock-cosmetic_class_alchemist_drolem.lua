return "New Class Option: #LIGHT_GREEN#Drolem",
[[You have defeated Tannen with your Alchemist and took some time to figure how he built a mighty Drolem.
Drolems are dragon-shaped golems able to breath powerful poison at their foes.

You may now create alchemist characters with a drolem instead of a golem.
Drolems look awesome and can eventually learn to breathe poison.

#LIGHT_GREEN#This is only available to donators. Thanks for your support!
