It's been some time since High Sun Paladin Aeryn sent me out on an assignment. According to recent intelligence, it would seem that a cavern has mysteriously emerged near our outpost, the Gates of Morning. They have bestowed the name "Ardhungol" on the newly discovered cavern. The elder warriors seem anxious in regards to the origin of this new subterranean area; they're likely concerned that the orcs are using Ardhungol as a staging point for further aggression against the Gates of Morning. I'll have to make sure I'm well equipped for this journey; the fate of us all could hang in the balance.

#{bold}#Journal Entry II#{normal}#

I spoke with the border patrols tonight. There seem to have been several sightings of orcs and other wild beasts roaming throughout the wilderness, yet strangely enough, none seem to have been anywhere near Ardhungol. Perhaps the subterranean cavern was simply a natural phenomenon with unfortunate timing. It's either that, or an unknown force powerful enough to alter the very foundation of the land upon its arrival. I shudder at the latter thought, but for now this is all merely speculation. If all goes well, I'll be ready to depart by dawn.

It was a half days journey from the Gates of Morning to Ardhungol, but I've finally arrived. I've decided to rest beneath the shade of a great oak tree and enjoy one of the sweet rolls my wife Melnela prepared for me. I'm unsure why, but the closer I've come to Ardhungol, the thicker the atmosphere has become, almost as if there is a foreign energy infecting the very air I breathe. I've been to many places in this vast world, but I've never felt an aura quite like this; I will have to uncover the source of this energy before I can bring a full report back to Aeryn.

#{bold}#Journal Entry IV#{normal}#

A thick green veil of mist permeates the air within this cavern; I'm uncertain if this is a byproduct of whatever creatures now inhabit this place, or if it's coming directly from another source. There also seem to be arcane rifts appearing in different locations throughout the cavern, though I dare not approach them; I will leave them for our anorithils to assess after I have secured the area. I must admit, I'm not looking forward to encountering the origin of a threat this grave, yet it is my sworn duty as a Sun Paladin to face what lies ahead; even should it be my own doom.

#{bold}#Journal Entry V#{normal}#

Impossible; how could spiders have grown to such an immense size? Not only that, but the markings and physical traits are unlike any arachnid I have previously encountered. The first one I encountered nearly took my left arm during its initial assault, if my reflexes had been a split second slower, I fear the worst may have transpired. If the Gates of Morning are assaulted by not only the orcs, but also this new –found species of arachnids, I fear all hope will be lost. For the sake of all Eyal, I must venture further into this spider infested cavern and destroy the source of this incursion.

It took some time, but my muscles have started to adapt and react to the unique movements of these arachnid. The way they fight, it's almost as if they possess a higher level of thought, elevating them far beyond the base intelligence of lesser arachnid... is it possible that they could be sentient? Do they act individually, or are they perhaps manipulated by a greater arachnid? Let us pray that this species is not connected through a hive mind, for this threat could become even greater than I had imagined.

#{bold}#Journal Entry VII#{normal}#

I have slain dozens of these arachnids, each one seemingly more difficult than the last. I am unsure if this is a result of my weariness, or if they are also adapting to my movements and battle techniques. I don't see how that could be possible however, a mere spider couldn't possibly adapt to the battle techniques of a veteran Sun Paladin, it's simply not feasible. Furthermore, the origin of these spiders worries me. So far I have not found any other entrances to this cavern, meaning they were transported here via other means. Those arcane rifts I found earlier are starting to worry me, and I fear for us all when I think of what may be waiting for us beyond them. I must put these thoughts out of my mind; distractions will only serve to weaken my resolve.

#{bold}#Journal Entry VIII#{normal}#

Incredible, the size of that arachnid is unimaginable; there is no doubt about it, that spider is the matriarch here. I am heavily wounded, but there is no turning back now; I must finish what I started for the sake of all those awaiting my return. If I don't make it back, whoever is now reading this journal, please make High Sun Paladin Aeryn at the Gates of Morning aware of the grave situation... and tell Melnela that I'm sorry.]]
