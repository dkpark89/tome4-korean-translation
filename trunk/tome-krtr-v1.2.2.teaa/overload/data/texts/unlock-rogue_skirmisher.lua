return "New Class: #LIGHT_GREEN#Skirmisher (Rogue)",
[[In Maj'Eyal threats are everywhere when you walk the wildlands, some rogues prefer to forgo the use of stealth instead using their cunning skills to kill silently from afar with a sling well protected with a buckler.

You have learned the power of counterstriking from afar and can now create characters with the #LIGHT_GREEN#Skirmisher class#WHITE#.

Skirmishers are highly mobile rogues that specialize in running and gunning, using Slings to harass, debilitate, and wear down enemies before finishing them off with extremely quick attacks.

Class features:#YELLOW#
- Vault and roll around your foes, staying one step ahead and just out of
reach
- Cripple your opponents and unleash a torrent of sling bullets
- Block enemy fire with your buckler mastery and counter attack#WHITE#

Skirmisher use stamina to fuel their techniques, which replenishes slowly over time.
